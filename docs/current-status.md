Current phase: Development / source-level userscript business gates

Prepared `src/dxm-automation-core/business-gates.js` as an offline-tested pure business-gate module. It standardizes deterministic blocker decisions for crawlbox contamination, trusted Amazon displayed-price readiness, current-task price formula readiness, AliExpress / learned-rule category evidence, freight template `111`, Ships From `United States`, and composed edit-save readiness.

Modules affected:
- src/dxm-automation-core/business-gates.js
- src/dxm-automation-core/index.js
- src/dxm-automation-core/workflow-diagnostics.js
- tools/dxm-automation-core.test.js

Main userscript adapter:
- `src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js` now adds a minimal readonly preflight normalization seam.
- Readonly preflight output includes `businessGate.allowed`, normalized `businessGate.blockers`, and `businessGate.nextAction`.
- DOM selection, Ant dropdown handling, WebBridge, native save, final publish, one-click publish, collection, and claim execution behavior were not expanded by this source pass.

Business blocker coverage:
- collection-box duplicate / non-target / missing / invalid-price contamination.
- `amazon_displayed_price_missing`.
- `price_out_of_range_or_zero`.
- `price_formula_missing_exchange_rate_or_multiplier`.
- `category_evidence_missing`.
- `aliexpress_dxm_category_map_missing`.
- `product_category_not_selected`.
- `postage_template_not_111`.
- `ships_from_not_united_states`.

Audit hardening:
- Tiered price formulas must cover the current Amazon USD price and compute a non-empty CNY value before the price gate can pass.
- `safeAdjacentAllowed` is only a marker for a real safe-adjacent DXM candidate category; it cannot replace the DXM category mapping itself.
- Product `Origin` is not accepted as variation `Ships From`; the Ships From gate requires explicit Ships From / label readback.

Test surface:
- `tools/dxm-automation-core.test.js` now covers the business gates together with existing text, pricing, PC detail, and workflow-diagnostics pure modules.
- Full local verification for this branch is recorded in `docs/test-results.md`.

Runtime boundary:
- The installed Tampermonkey runtime artifact remains the existing single userscript.
- No live Dianxiaomi page action, collection, claim, edit, save, move-to-wait-publish, publish, one-click publish, or browser automation was executed for this documentation/source-level gate task.

Next engineering step:
- Continue the second-layer extraction later by wiring readonly preflight, batch gate, and WebBridge reports to the same pure blocker vocabulary.

Current phase: Development / source-level userscript pure-module extraction and root-cause diagnostics

Prepared source-level pure modules under src/dxm-automation-core for text rules, pricing/dimension rules, PC detail image-first rules, and workflow root-cause diagnostics. Added tools/dxm-automation-core.test.js as the second explicit Node assertion test. No live Dianxiaomi page action, collection, claim, edit, save, publish, or one-click publish was executed.

Modules added:
- src/dxm-automation-core/text-rules.js
- src/dxm-automation-core/pricing-rules.js
- src/dxm-automation-core/pc-detail-rules.js
- src/dxm-automation-core/workflow-diagnostics.js
- src/dxm-automation-core/index.js

Documentation assets updated:
- docs/assets/architecture-overview-en.png
- docs/assets/architecture-overview-zh.png
- The previous SVG overview assets were replaced by the approved bilingual proven execution flow diagrams.

Test surface now includes two explicit Node assertion tests:
- tools/aliexpress-evidence-policy.test.js
- tools/dxm-automation-core.test.js

Audit follow-up:
- The extracted pricing helper now has regression coverage for task-parameterized price calculation. It can parse Amazon displayed price ranges such as `$8.99 - $12.99`, but range handling, high-price tiers, and the final goods-value formula must come from the current task configuration, not a global constant.
- Amazon displayed-price candidates include current buy-box price, displayed ranges, variant prices, and strike/list prices such as `List Price`.
- `tools/amazon-displayed-price-capture.js`, `tools/amazon-displayed-price-batch.js`, and the extracted pricing helper now default to `highest_displayed_value`, for example `$8.99 - $12.99` -> `$12.99` and `Price $19.94 List Price: $20.99` -> `$20.99`.
- `--range-policy` / `TASK_PRICE_RANGE_POLICY` remain override inputs, but the goods-value formula itself is still task configuration: every task must provide its own exchange rate, multiplier or tiered multiplier strategy, and rounding rule.
- `skills/price-processing/SKILL.md` now follows the same principle: select the Amazon USD displayed-price candidate first, then apply the current task formula; do not reuse `x 7 x 1.55` as a global rule.
- The root-cause diagnostics helper now has an offline regression for the known 10-target / 16-row collection-box contamination case: duplicate rows are classified as `crawlbox_duplicate_rows`, the three zero-price ASINs are classified as `price_out_of_range_or_zero`, and only the seven unique price-valid ASINs are considered safe claim candidates.
- The same helper normalizes readonly edit preflight blockers into machine root causes such as `category_evidence_missing`, `product_category_not_selected`, `postage_template_not_111`, and `ships_from_not_united_states`, confirming that the first edit page was blocked by the save preflight gate rather than by a missing save button.

Runtime boundary:
- The installed Tampermonkey runtime artifact remains the existing single userscript.
- DOM automation, Ant dropdown interactions, WebBridge, preflight readback, native save, publishing, and panel UI remain in the userscript adapter.
- This task does not authorize live Dianxiaomi business actions.

Documentation drift rule:
- Development work must update relevant docs before completion when code behavior, test surface, safety boundary, or project status changes.
- The principle-level rule is recorded in AGENT.md under Long-term Hard Rules.

Maintenance language rule:
- Chinese is the default language for PR titles, PR bodies, review discussion, and maintenance notes.
- English can remain for code identifiers, exact logs, external platform terms, or bilingual docs, but Chinese is the default human-facing maintenance language.

Current phase: Validation / v2.1.44 collection-box recovery quality flow verified via wait-to-publish product

Prepared:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v2.1.44
- Source: src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js

Why v2.1.44:
- v2.1.43 fixed marketing image readback and PC description image-first requirements.
- Live wait-to-publish validation exposed one remaining timing issue:
  - PC description write returned imageState 5/2.
  - Immediate readback still saw 0/2 because CKEditor / hidden detail fields needed a short async settle.
  - Three seconds later readonly preflight passed.
- v2.1.44 adds PC-description image readback polling after writing the description.

Scope:
- This is still the collection-box re-edit / recovery logic path:
  - window.__DXM_AUTOMATION_V1_RECOVER_TO_WAIT_PUBLISH__
  - shared remaining edit-page flow
- The wait-to-publish page was used only because the relevant products had already been moved there.
- No collection, reclaim, category, price, required-attribute, variation, final publish, one-click publish, or Product Development draft logic was changed.

Live checked:
- Page: 速卖通海外托管 > 待发布 > 编辑
- Product/ASIN: B0GKLXJCTZ
- editId: 167487782012872503

Validation result:
- Browser-installed version before temporary injection: 2.1.43.
- Readonly found the expected blocker:
  - PC description missing current product images: 0/2
  - PC description image-first layout missing: 0/2
- Running the same remaining edit-page flow first exposed the async readback timing issue.
- After v2.1.44 temporary injection:
  - flow result: ok=true
  - pc-description-images: current product images 5/2, image-first 5/2
  - marketing images: readable / ready
  - risks: []

Important boundary:
- No save was clicked.
- No final publish was clicked.
- No one-click publish was clicked.
- No collection/reclaim/Product Development draft action was executed.
- The two validation browser tabs were closed.
- Latest v2.1.44 script was copied to clipboard for browser userscript-manager overwrite.

Next safe step:
- User should overwrite the browser userscript manager with v2.1.44.
- Then validate a real collection-box recovery product with save:false first.
```

Current phase: Validation / second product existing recovery entry rerun, save still blocked

Live checked:
- Product: Clear Drawer Organizer for Office Bin Desk Storage...
- ASIN: B07MHXF8H5
- editId: 167487782012872539
- Live page script version: 2.1.41

Result:
- Used the existing collection-box rework entry for this edit page.
- No recollection, reclaim, Product Development draft handling, final publish, or one-click publish was executed.
- The rerun made progress:
  - category stayed correct: Storage Boxes & Bins
  - price stayed correct: CNY 151.57
  - Brand readback became NONE(AE存量)*******(None)
  - Frame Material readback became 塑料(Plastic)
- The flow stopped at required-attributes.use with a stage hard timeout.
- A direct field-only Use retry did not return a structured result and was interrupted.
- The automation lock was reset after the interruption.
- Final preflight stayed pass=false, so 保存并移入待发布 was not allowed and was not clicked.

Remaining blockers after rerun:
- Use / Function / Material still show 请选择.
- Postage template 111 is still not read back as selected.
- Ships From readback is still not accepted.
- Variation row still has missing/incorrect logisticValue, stock 15, SKU B07MHXF8H5, and required variation attribute.
- Imported custom attributes still contain invalid values.

Evidence:
- runs/b07mhxf8h5-v2141-second-retry-use-timeout.png

Next safe step:
- Treat this product as not saved.
- The immediate live blocker is the Use field interaction timeout in the current edit page, not category selection.
- Do not save this product until readonly final preflight returns pass=true and blockers=[].

Current phase: Validation / v2.1.43 wait-to-publish quality gates verified

Prepared:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v2.1.43
- Source: src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js

Scope:
- Only the confirmed missing marketing-image and PC-description image-first issues were changed.
- No rule files were changed.
- Collection, claim, category, price, required attributes, variation, final publish, one-click publish, and Product Development draft handling were not changed.

Implemented:
- PC description now prefers current product main images from edit data before page-visible image fallback.
- Remaining edit-page / recovery flow stops at pc-description-images if the rewritten PC description is not image-first with current product images.
- Remaining edit-page / recovery flow includes a bounded marketing-images stage.
- Marketing stage clicks the visible 一键生成 when marketing images are missing.
- Marketing readback now waits for async generation and reads a marketing section that actually contains images.
- Final preflight blocks save when PC description product images or marketing images are missing.

Live checked:
- Page: 速卖通海外托管 > 待发布 > 编辑
- Product/ASIN: B07M74SH62
- editId: 167487782012872549

Validation result:
- Initial readonly check with local v2.1.42 correctly blocked:
  - PC description missing current product images: 0/2
  - PC description image-first layout missing: 0/2
  - marketing images incomplete: 0/2
- Remaining edit-page flow was run without saving:
  - PC description repaired to image-first with current product images: 5/2
  - marketing 一键生成 was clicked
- After v2.1.43 wait/readback repair:
  - readonly version: 2.1.43
  - marketing images: 2/2
  - PC description current product images: 5/2
  - risks: []
  - preflight pass: true

Important boundary:
- No save was clicked.
- No final publish was clicked.
- No one-click publish was clicked.
- No collection/reclaim/Product Development draft action was executed.
- The two validation browser tabs were closed.
- Latest v2.1.43 script was copied to clipboard for browser userscript-manager overwrite.

Next safe step:
- User should overwrite the browser userscript manager with v2.1.43 before persistent live use.
- Then rerun one collection-box recovery product with save:false first; only save if final preflight stays pass=true.

Current phase: Validation / second product v2.1.41 category fix verified, save blocked

Live checked:
- Product: Clear Drawer Organizer for Office Bin Desk Storage...
- ASIN: B07MHXF8H5
- editId: 167487782012872539
- Script version: 2.1.41

Result:
- Page identity guard passed.
- save:false recovery was run only; no save was clicked.
- The previous category blocker was repaired:
  - selected/readback category: 收纳盒和收纳箱（有关婴儿食品储存的请发布到婴儿食品存储盒下）(Storage Boxes & Bins)
  - wrong Anti-Mosquito Incense category did not recur.
- Price was corrected to CNY 151.57 from Amazon displayed price USD 13.97 x 7 x 1.55.
- Final preflight still failed, so 保存并移入待发布 was not allowed.

Remaining blockers:
- Postage template 111 not selected.
- Required red-star attributes still missing: Use, Function, Material, Brand Name, Frame Material.
- Ships From readback was not accepted even though 美国(United States) text was present.
- Variation row still missing/incorrect: logisticValue, stock 15, SKU B07MHXF8H5.
- Imported custom attributes still invalid.

Evidence:
- runs/b07mhxf8h5-v2141-blockers.png

Next safe step:
- Treat B07MHXF8H5 as not saved.
- Do not patch code during this validation step.
- Continue to the next product unless the user explicitly asks to repair this product-specific blocker.

Prepared:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v2.1.40
- Source: src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js

Scope:
- This is for the collection-box recovery entry that edits products still in 速卖通海外托管 > 采集箱 and not yet saved to wait-to-publish.
- Entry remains window.__DXM_AUTOMATION_V1_RECOVER_TO_WAIT_PUBLISH__({ asin, editId, save }).
- It does not change collection, claim, forceEdit/direct edit URL opening, final publish, one-click publish, or Product Development draft handling.

- editId: 167487782012872549
- Script version: 2.1.39

Result:
- v2.1.39 fixed the false-positive required-attribute blocker for the Pen Holders category.
- Use / Function / Feature / Material were skipped because they were not current-page visible red-star required fields.
- Final preflight passed with blockers=[].
- Native 保存并移入待发布 was executed after preflight pass.
- Success modal appeared: 产品已移入待发布，请在「待发布」中查看！

Current phase: Debug / v2.1.39 required-attribute preflight false-positive fix prepared

Prepared:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v2.1.39
- Source: src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js

Implemented:
- Final preflight now requires a current-page visible red required marker before known dynamic fields can become required-attribute blockers.
- Use / Function / Feature / Material / Frame Material are skipped when absent, hidden, stale, or visible without a red-star required marker.
- Native Dianxiaomi product-attribute validation remains a blocker when the page actually reports it.
- v2.1.38 variation Ships From / Color logic, direct-edit recovery entry, price logic, collection, claim, save, final publish, and one-click publish controls were not changed.

Verification:
- node --check passed.
- Targeted source assertions passed for version 2.1.39, red-star helper wiring, known-field red-star gating, optional non-red-star Material skip, and unsafe-display scanning from red-star rows.
- No browser save, final publish, one-click publish, new collection, reclaim, or Product Development draft action was executed for this source update.

Important boundary:
- Real visible red-star fields such as Product application scenarios / Theme must still block save until filled or classified; this fix only removes non-current/non-red-star false blockers such as a Pen Holders page reporting Use when no Use field exists.

- Product: 4 Pack Silicone Trivets...
- ASIN: B0GKLXJCTZ
- editId: 167487782012872503
- Script version: 2.1.38

Result:
- save:false recovery returned normally; no 90-second hang.
- Second blocker passed:
  - 发货地 selected only 美国(United States).
  - Color selected 多色(MULTI), because source variants contained black and gray.
  - Variation row required fields were filled/read back OK:

Current phase: Validation / second variation-parameter blocker prepared in source

Prepared:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v2.1.38
- Source: src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js

Implemented:
- Variation parameter 发货地 / Ships From now enforces only 美国(United States).
- If other country checkboxes are selected in the same variation-parameter section, they are cleared.
- Color variation parameter now runs whenever Color options are visible, before native save validation.
- If a real single color is clearly detected, that color can still be selected.
- If color is unclear or no single-color evidence exists, default is fixed to 多色(MULTI).
- 拼花色(Mixed Color) is not used as the default.
- Checkbox-based Color controls are kept to one selected Color option.

Verification:
- node --check passed.
- Targeted assertions passed for version 2.1.38, only-US Ships From enforcement, Color visible handling, unknown Color -> 多色(MULTI), and removed old skip path.
- No browser save, final publish, one-click publish, new collection, reclaim, or Product Development draft action was executed for this source update.

Next safe step:
- Copy v2.1.38 to the browser userscript manager.
- Then validate on a product that still requires edit-to-wait-publish, with no publish and no one-click publish.

Current phase: Validation / first required-attribute blocker fixed and B0CZ reached wait-to-publish

Prepared:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v2.1.37
- Source: src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js

Implemented:
- Brand fixed to the concrete Dianxiaomi option: NONE(AE存量)*******(None)
- High-concerned chemical remains fixed to: 天然未处理(None)
- Origin fixed to: 美国(Origin)(US(Origin))
- Removed Mainland China / China fallback from the visible required-attribute rule.
- Custom attributes remain non-required: clear/delete/skip by default.

Verification:
- node --check passed.
- Targeted assertions passed for version, fixed values, no Mainland China fallback, and custom-attribute skip.
- Script copied to clipboard.
- Browser validation opened exact B0CZ7F61XN / editId 167487782009931563 and verified v2.1.37.
- Page readback showed: 速卖通海外托管 > 待发布 > 编辑.
- Red-star attributes were OK.
- customAttributeCount=0 and customAttributeInvalidCount=0.
- Final preflight pass=true, blockers=[].
- No 保存并移入待发布 button was present because the product was already in wait-to-publish edit state.
- The save guard stopped without clicking save or publish.
- No final publish or one-click publish.
- Browser task page closed.

Follow-up recheck:
- User asked to verify the same product from the collection box after v2.1.37 overwrite.
- Opened/refreshed `速卖通海外托管 > 采集箱`.
- Collection box count was 9, and B0CZ7F61XN was not found in the collection-box list.
- Opened exact editId 167487782009931563 readonly.
- v2.1.37 matched, ASIN guard passed, and page showed wait-to-publish edit context.
- Fixed fields read back OK:
  - Brand: NONE(AE存量)*******(None)
  - High-concerned chemical: 天然未处理(None)
  - Origin: 美国(Origin)(US(Origin))
- customAttributeCount=0, customAttributeInvalidCount=0.
- preflight pass=true, blockers=[].
- No save, publish, or one-click publish was clicked.
- Browser task pages closed.

Current conclusion:
- The B0CZ recovery target has reached wait-to-publish state.
- Do not continue trying to run collection-box save-to-wait-publish on this same editId.
- Next optimization should use another collection-box product or a dedicated readonly wait-to-publish verification path.

- Final publish / one-click publish: 0.

Current blockers:
- Category automation can misselect wrong leaves, especially `Anti-Mosquito Incense` for non-mosquito products.
- SKU/variation fields often remain incomplete after edit-rule execution.
- Freight template `111`, Ships From, required attributes, and custom attributes remain common save blockers.

Current phase: Validation / collection-box recovery reached ready_to_save with save=false

Prepared and verified:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v2.1.36
- Source: src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js

Implemented:
- Fixed variation table header mapping so row validation text cannot overwrite the real 尺寸(cm) column index.
- Added dedicated length / width / height size input lookup.
- Skipped non-required variation color action unless Dianxiaomi explicitly shows required variation attribute error.

Verification completed:
- node --check src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js passed.
- Targeted assertions passed for version 2.1.36, recovery entry safety, exact save button, size helper, header mapping, and non-required color skip.
- Browser validation on B0CZ7F61XN / editId 167487782009931563:
  - Entry returned in 37.3s with save:false.
  - afterBlockers=[]
  - variation size OK: 13.21 x 13.21 x 14.99
  - safeToSaveToWaitPublish=true
  - stoppedAt=ready_to_save
  - saved=false
  - Save button found: 保存并移入待发布
  - No save, no move-to-wait-publish, no publish, no one-click publish.
  - Browser validation page was closed, discarding unsaved save:false edits.

Next safe step:
- If user authorizes, rerun the same exact page with save:true to click only 保存并移入待发布.
- Still do not final publish or one-click publish.

Current phase: Validation / collection-box recovery reached variation-size blocker

Prepared and verified:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v2.1.34
- Source: src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js

Implemented:
- Fixed required fields run before the generic required-attribute stage:
  - High-concerned chemical = 天然未处理(None)
  - Origin = 美国(Origin)(US(Origin))
- High-concerned chemical Ant multi-select now reads hidden/animation listbox aria-label/title options.
- Origin single-select now uses the same aria-label/title option lookup.
- Generic required-attribute timeouts can continue when current DOM readback proves required attributes are OK.
- Generic required-attribute pass skips already-fixed high/origin to avoid reprocessing them.

Verification completed:
- node --check src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js passed.
- Targeted assertions passed for version 2.1.34, recovery entry, save=false default, exact save button, fixed field ordering, and dropdown lookup.
- Browser validation on B0CZ7F61XN / editId 167487782009931563:
  - Entry returned in 37.5s with save:false.
  - High-concerned chemical OK.
  - Origin OK.
  - Brand/material/red-star required attributes OK.
  - Postage template 111 OK.
  - Custom attributes cleanup stage ran.
  - No save, no move-to-wait-publish, no publish, no one-click publish.
  - Result: saved=false, safeToSaveToWaitPublish=false.

Current blocker:
- variation required fields incomplete: size

Next safe step:
- Fix/segment the variation size fill/readback path only.
- Continue on the same exact edit page with save:false.
- Do not save unless final preflight pass=true and blockers=0.

Current phase: Validation / 10 different-category live run stopped at claim-modal store-list blocker

User authorized a new 10-product Validation run from collection to wait-to-publish, with no publish and no one-click publish.

Prepared and verified before Dianxiaomi business actions:
- Candidate file: runs/validation-10-different-categories-20260703-candidates.json
- ASIN file: runs/validation-10-different-categories-20260703-asins.txt
- Product risk filter passed 10/10 after replacing initial blocked/review candidates.
- Amazon displayed price capture passed 10/10 and wrote trusted prices to runs/amazon-price-store.json.
- ASIN-level category evidence passed 10/10 in runs/aliexpress-evidence-store.json.
- dxm-batch-pipeline plan showed total 10, manifestAutoReady 10, gateReady 10, blockers 0.

Dianxiaomi live actions executed:
- Opened data acquisition page.
- Read back active scripts: DXM Amazon Crawlbox V1 v0.1.34, DXM Automation V1 V2.1.21, save Payload V3 0.6.3.
- Confirmed native auto-claim closed.
- Inserted 10 current Amazon links and clicked only 开始采集.
- Collection result: successful 7, failed 1 (B09QGCKMZS).
- Duplicate collection modal showed B088HGQSZT and B0B4QZD77M as already collected; clicked 跳过, no duplicate recollection.
- Selected 7 current newly collected rows; old row B07D5DN269 stayed unselected.
- Opened batch claim modal twice.

Blocker:
- Claim modal did not render concrete Halo Home Store under 速卖通海外托管.
- Modal showed 速卖通海外托管 group with render-skeleton and 已选(0) after wait/search/reopen.
- No 确定 click was executed.
- No claim, edit, final preflight, save-to-wait-publish, final publish, one-click publish, Product Development, or draft handling was executed.

Report:
- runs/validation-10-different-categories-20260703.md

Next safe step:
- Fix or recover the Dianxiaomi claim-modal store-list rendering path, then continue only the 7 collected current rows.
- Do not recollect the duplicate ASINs B088HGQSZT / B0B4QZD77M or failed B09QGCKMZS without explicit recovery authorization.

Current phase: Validation / collection-box recovery returns concrete required-attribute blocker

Prepared local source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v2.1.21
- src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js

Reason:
- Live browser validation confirmed the recovery entry existed and identity readback worked for B0CZ7F61XN / editId 167487782009931563.
- Calling window.__DXM_AUTOMATION_V1_RECOVER_TO_WAIT_PUBLISH__({ asin, editId, save:false }) did not return within 90 seconds.
- Last readonly preflight still showed postage 111, required attributes, and variation required fields incomplete.

Implemented:
- Recovery entry now passes a bounded stage timeout into remaining-field recovery.
- Required-attribute dropdown selection now cooperatively checks deadline during option scan, filtering, list scrolling, option commit, and readback.
- Postage template 111 selection now accepts deadline and returns timedOut/stoppedAt instead of hanging.
- Fixed recovery fields High-concerned chemical and Origin each get field-level timeout.
- If recovery stops early, the entry returns structured result with timedOut, stoppedAt, reason, timeoutDetail, completed stages, before/after readonly preflight, and save=false.
- Default save remains false; only save:true can click save.
- Save target remains exact text 保存并移入待发布 only.
- Fixed values remain unique:
  - High-concerned chemical: 天然未处理(None)
  - Origin: 美国(Origin)(US(Origin))

Verification completed:
- node --check src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js passed.
- Local assertions passed for version 2.1.21, recovery entry, save=false default, exact save button, timeout wiring, stage progress, bounded stages, field-level stoppedAt, and fixed field values.
- Browser validation completed on exact page B0CZ7F61XN / editId 167487782009931563:
  - v2.1.19 still exceeded external 90-second wait and was interrupted.
  - v2.1.20 returned in 19.7 seconds with stoppedAt=required-attributes.
  - v2.1.21 returned in 19.1 seconds with stoppedAt=required-attributes.high_concerned_chemical.
  - Result saved=false, safeToSaveToWaitPublish=false.
  - No save/move-to-wait-publish/final publish/one-click publish was executed.
  - Current concrete blocker is High-concerned chemical Ant multi-select still reading 请选择; Origin also still reads 请选择.
  - The browser task page was closed through WebBridge after validation, intentionally discarding unsaved save:false field edits.

Not executed:
- No browser action.
- No Dianxiaomi field edit.
- No save or move-to-wait-publish.
- No final publish or one-click publish.
- No collection, reclaim, or Product Development draft handling.

Next safe step:
- Fix the High-concerned chemical Ant multi-select commit path or add a direct field-only recovery path for this field.
- Re-run the exact B0CZ direct edit page from a clean page.
- Call the recovery entry with save:false and require a structured result.
- Do not save unless final preflight pass=true and blockers=0.

Current phase: Validation / AliExpress evidence threshold and DXM fallback routing patched

Implemented the user-approved category-evidence optimization locally only:
- Direct conditional AliExpress evidence pass line is now 50%, configured in config/aliexpress-evidence-thresholds.json.
- >=80% remains high confidence.
- 50%-79% becomes conditional_verified / medium_confidence only when usage/form consistency, no obvious conflict, and non-risk checks pass.
- <50% with semantic consistency no longer becomes a hard product failure. With detail capture it tries 2 matching AliExpress detail pages; if detail evidence is inconclusive, it routes to dxm_category_validation_required.
- dxm_category_validation_required means: do not save; run Dianxiaomi readonly category validation / edit preflight fallback first.

Updated:
- config/aliexpress-evidence-thresholds.json
- tools/aliexpress-evidence-policy.js
- tools/aliexpress-evidence-policy.test.js
- tools/aliexpress-evidence-capture.js
- tools/aliexpress-evidence-batch.js
- tools/dxm-batch-execution-gate.js
- tools/candidate-manifest.js
- tools/exception-queue.js
- config/aliexpress-evidence.schema.json
- docs/category-resolution-system.md

Verification completed:
- node --check passed for modified JS files.
- JSON parse passed for evidence schema and threshold config.
- Local policy test passed.
- Synthetic evidence test confirmed 50% => conditional_verified / medium_confidence.
- Synthetic evidence test confirmed <50% semantic-consistent detail failure => dxm_category_validation_required.
- Temporary dxm-batch-execution-gate plan confirmed dxm_category_validation_required is blocked, readyForEditPreflight=false, nextAction=run_dxm_readonly_category_validation.
- Real first-batch local dxm-batch-pipeline plan dry-run still passes with no browser actions and no writes: total 10, gateReady 6, blocked 4. Existing formal evidence-store records were not rewritten; remaining blocked ASINs need recapture/re-evidence to apply the new 50% rule.

No browser action, Dianxiaomi edit/save, move-to-wait-publish, final publish, one-click publish, Product Development draft handling, recollection, or reclaim was executed for this patch.

Current phase: Validation / B0CZ7F61XN low-confidence detail evidence verified

The low-confidence AliExpress category evidence flow has been optimized and validated on the real B0CZ7F61XN faucet-mat product.

New project rule:
- If AliExpress search-result top postCategoryId consensus is <60%, do not directly block when titles are semantically consistent.
- With explicit detail capture, open 2 representative AliExpress product detail pages.
- Scroll/read specification fields: 类型 / 类别 / 产品类型 / 商品类型 / 专用工具类型 / Product Type / Category / Special Tool Type.
- If both highly similar detail pages show the same or equivalent type, record detail_verified / detail_low_confidence / detail_type_consensus.
- The consensus detail type, for example 厨房水龙头配件, can drive the Dianxiaomi category modal search automatically.
- Final save is still forbidden unless the edit page final preflight passes with blockers=0.
- AliExpress verification/CAPTCHA pages are recorded as aliexpress_verification_required; the automation does not bypass them and does not let the whole batch deadlock.

Updated:
- tools/aliexpress-evidence-capture.js
- tools/aliexpress-evidence-store.js
- tools/aliexpress-evidence-batch.js
- tools/aliexpress-evidence-browser-cache.js
- tools/dxm-batch-execution-gate.js
- tools/candidate-manifest.js
- tools/exception-queue.js
- config/aliexpress-evidence.schema.json
- src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js
- AGENT.md / AGENTS.md
- docs/category-resolution-system.md
- docs/exception-rules.md

Verification completed:
- node --check passed for modified JS files.
- JSON parse passed for config/aliexpress-evidence.schema.json.
- Temporary detail_verified evidence write/readback passed.
- Temporary gate plan allowed B0CZ7F61XN to readonly edit preflight only when detail evidence exists.
- Temporary aliexpress_verification_required evidence blocked and routed to resolve_aliexpress_verification_then_resume_detail_capture.
- Live readonly AliExpress detail capture for B0CZ7F61XN checked 3 representative detail pages and matched 2 usable detail records:
  - 专用工具类型 = 飞溅屏幕
  - 类型 = 专用工具, normalized within the faucet-mat/splash-guard semantic family to 飞溅屏幕
- Formal evidence-store write/readback completed for B0CZ7F61XN:
  - status detail_verified
  - dxmCandidateCategory 飞溅屏幕
  - evidenceConfidence 0.6
  - confidenceTier detail_low_confidence
  - verificationMode detail_type_consensus
- Formal execution gate dry-run now reports B0CZ7F61XN readyForEditPreflight=true with blockers=0.
- Resolved stale exception `b0cz7f61xn::aliexpress_dxm_category_map_missing` after formal evidence readback passed.
- Reran local `dxm-batch-pipeline plan` for the first 10 ASINs:
  - manifestAutoReady 6
  - gateReady 6
  - blocked 4
  - ready/edit-preflight queue: B0CZ7F61XN, B0DXFB86J7, B0DPSJP47V, B0F1DDLKBB, B0CTBQCKL9, B0FH7774VK
  - remaining evidence work: B0DZ14L38Y, B01E2EYG4U, B0GFV4N3K8, B0C1JY1C7F
- Attempted readonly `dxm-batch-pipeline check --edit-preflight` for B0CZ7F61XN. The browser/session had no open/located edit tab, so no real edit-page preflight was read.
- Fixed `tools/dxm-batch-execution-gate.js` safety handling so failed/missing edit preflight blocks with `edit_preflight_unavailable`; final gate no longer suggests save unless a real edit-page preflight report exists and passes.
- Verification rerun now reports B0CZ7F61XN final gate blocked by `edit_preflight_unavailable`, next action `open_correct_edit_page_and_rerun_readonly_preflight`.

No Dianxiaomi edit/save, final publish, one-click publish, Product Development draft handling, recollection, or reclaim was executed.

Next safe step:
- Open the correct B0CZ7F61XN Dianxiaomi edit page from a fresh browser session and rerun readonly edit preflight.
- Do not save unless final preflight pass=true and blockers=0.
```

Current phase: Validation / remaining 6 evidence follow-up completed

AliExpress evidence threshold is now implemented at project/tool level:
- >=80% top postCategoryId consensus + DXM candidate category => aliexpress_verified / high_confidence.
- 60%-79% can only pass as conditional_verified / low_confidence when DXM candidate category, usage/form consistency, no obvious conflict, and risk clearance are all satisfied.
- <60% now enters a semantic-consensus second pass instead of direct split. If titles are semantically consistent but no safe DXM candidate exists, record semantic_consensus_needs_dxm_mapping; if a safe DXM candidate exists, record conditional_verified / semantic_low_confidence; only true semantic/category conflict remains evidence_split.

Updated:
- tools/aliexpress-evidence-capture.js
- tools/aliexpress-evidence-store.js
- tools/aliexpress-evidence-batch.js
- config/aliexpress-evidence.schema.json
- AGENT.md / AGENTS.md
- docs/category-resolution-system.md
- docs/exception-rules.md

Executed readonly AliExpress evidence dry-run/writeback for the remaining 7 first-batch ASINs:
- B0CZ7F61XN: semantic_consensus_needs_dxm_mapping, 42%, postCategoryId 100003261, semantic family faucet-mat-splash-guard
- B0DZ14L38Y: semantic_consensus_needs_dxm_mapping, 38%, postCategoryId 100003261, semantic family faucet-mat-splash-guard
- B0F1DDLKBB: conditional_verified / semantic_low_confidence, 15%, postCategoryId 200089142, semantic family bag-holder-dispenser, DXM 收纳架(Racks & Holders)
- B0CTBQCKL9: conditional_verified / semantic_low_confidence, 52%, postCategoryId 200042150, semantic family bag-holder-dispenser, DXM 收纳架(Racks & Holders)
- B01E2EYG4U: evidence_split, 50%, postCategoryId 201222631
- B0GFV4N3K8: evidence_split, 42%, postCategoryId 370803
- B0C1JY1C7F: evidence_split, 38%, postCategoryId 370803

Formal write/readback:
- runs/aliexpress-evidence-store.json now has 2 semantic_consensus_needs_dxm_mapping records, 2 conditional_verified / semantic_low_confidence records, and 3 evidence_split records for the remaining ASINs.
- runs/exception-queue.json now has 2 open aliexpress_dxm_category_map_missing blockers and 3 open aliexpress_category_evidence_split blockers for the remaining ASINs.
- Evidence summary for first batch: verified 5 total, highConfidence 3, conditionalVerified 2, semanticConsensusNeedsMapping 2, blockers 5.

B0CZ7F61XN first-product mapping review:
- Browser action type: Dianxiaomi collection-box/edit-classification readonly attempt only.
- Action executed: located the B0CZ7F61XN collection-box row, opened the edit classification prompt, and attempted the classification step for category confirmation.
- No Dianxiaomi save, move-to-wait-publish, final publish, one-click publish, Product Development draft handling, recollection, or reclaim was executed.
- Result: no safe DXM leaf category was confirmed from the page. Existing validated `Kitchen Drains & Strainers` mapping must not be reused because B0CZ is a faucet mat / sink splash guard, not a drain, strainer, or sink stopper.
- `config/aliexpress-dxm-category-map.json` now records `postCategoryId=100003261` as `needs_review`, with blocked wrong categories including `Kitchen Drains & Strainers`, `Kitchen Faucets`, and `Kitchen Soap Dispensers`.
- Decision: B0CZ7F61XN remains blocked at `aliexpress_dxm_category_map_missing`; do not edit/save it until a precise or explicitly safe adjacent DXM leaf is confirmed.

Pipeline rerun:
- dxm-batch-pipeline plan dry-run passed.
- Safety flags: no business actions, no browser actions, no report write, no exception write, no price write during final plan rerun.
- Raw gate-ready is now 5: B0DXFB86J7, B0DPSJP47V, B0FH7774VK, B0F1DDLKBB, B0CTBQCKL9.
- After excluding the three already in wait-to-publish, new ready ASINs: B0F1DDLKBB, B0CTBQCKL9.
- Blocker counts: aliexpress_dxm_category_map_missing=2, aliexpress_category_evidence_split=3.

Decision:
- Do not edit/save B0CZ7F61XN or B0DZ14L38Y until a precise or explicitly safe adjacent DXM leaf is confirmed for faucet mat / sink splash guard.
- Do not promote B01E2EYG4U, B0GFV4N3K8, or B0C1JY1C7F from split until readable-title evidence or safe DXM mapping is confirmed.
- Next controlled step is readonly edit preflight for the new ready ASINs B0F1DDLKBB and B0CTBQCKL9 only; save remains forbidden unless final preflight pass=true and blockers=0.

Current phase: Validation / third ready product closed loop completed

B0FH7774VK has completed the edit-to-wait-publish closed loop.

Code source:
- src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js
- Current local source version: DXM Automation V1 - NEW v2.1.14
- Browser validation used controlled runtime injection; persistent Tampermonkey should be overwritten before broader live validation.

Gate confirmation before edit:
- Current edit ASIN/SKU: B0FH7774VK
- Amazon displayed-price store: trusted, USD 15.58, expected CNY 169.04
- AliExpress category evidence: aliexpress_verified, candidate category 收纳架(Racks & Holders)
- Initial readonly preflight correctly blocked save before field fill.

Code repair in v2.1.14:
- The main edit-page pipeline now calls the existing PC-description filler after title normalization.
- This fixed the B0FH blocker where all other fields could pass but final preflight still failed with PC description too short.

Final preflight before save:
- pass=true
- blockers=0
- Category: 收纳架(Racks & Holders)
- Freight template: 111
- Ships From: 美国(United States)
- Price: CNY 169.04
- Stock: 15
- Brand/Feature/High-concerned chemical/Origin/Material were selected from real options and read back.
- Custom attributes after cleanup: 0

Business action executed:
- Clicked native edit-page 保存并移入待发布 once after final preflight passed.
- Result message: 产品已移入待发布，请在「待发布」中查看！
- No final publish, no one-click publish, no Product Development draft handling, no recollection, and no reclaim executed.

- Category: 收纳架(Racks & Holders)
- Price: CNY 169.04
- Stock: 15
- Readback result: pass
- Field mismatches: 0

Current decision:
- Small closed-loop stability is now confirmed for three products: B0DXFB86J7, B0DPSJP47V, and B0FH7774VK.
- Ten-item pressure-test preparation was started from local gate data and a local `dxm-batch-pipeline plan` dry-run.
- The dry-run safety flags were clean: no business actions, no browser actions, no report/exception/price-store writes.
- The original first batch has no remaining edit-ready ASINs after excluding the three completed closed loops.
- Remaining first-batch blockers: 6 category_evidence_missing and 1 aliexpress_category_evidence_split.
- Do not expand to 10 edit-save actions until the remaining category evidence gates are repaired and dxm-batch-pipeline plan is rerun.

Current phase: Validation / B0DPSJP47V edit-page field-control repair closed loop

B0DPSJP47V is now saved to wait-to-publish and read back successfully.

Repair source:
- src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js
- Current local source version: DXM Automation V1 - NEW v2.1.13
- Browser validation used temporary runtime injection; persistent Tampermonkey may still need overwrite before broader live validation.

Validated field-control fixes:
- Category modal no longer interrupts downstream fields after category is written.
- Current-ASIN price writes from trusted Amazon displayed-price store and reads back as CNY 108.39.
- Freight template 111 is selected and read back from the exact freight-template field.
- Ships From United States is checked and read back.
- Brand, Feature, High-concerned chemical, Origin, and Material are selected from real dropdown options and read back.
- Variation field pass is aligned with final preflight when global Ships From is already selected.
- Final preflight passed with 0 blockers before save.

Business action executed:
- Clicked native edit-page 保存并移入待发布 once after preflight pass.
- Result message: 产品已移入待发布，请在「待发布」中查看！
- No final publish, no one-click publish, no Product Development draft handling, no recollection, and no reclaim executed.

- Price: CNY 108.39
- Stock: 15
- Readback result: pass
- Field mismatches: 0

Current decision:
- Superseded by latest update above: small closed-loop stability is now confirmed for three products after B0FH7774VK completed under v2.1.14.
- Do not expand to 10 edit-save actions until remaining category-evidence gates are repaired and the batch pipeline is rerun.

Current phase: Validation / first real small closed-loop edit-to-wait-publish verification

Small closed loop completed for one pipeline-ready ASIN:
- Run report: runs/first-batch-small-loop-20260702.md
- Selected ASIN/SKU: B0DXFB86J7
- Source gate: runs/dxm-batch-pipeline-first-batch-after-price-evidence-20260702.json
- Business action executed: native edit-page save/move to wait-to-publish only
- Final publish: not executed
- One-click publish: not executed
- Product Development draft handling: not executed
- Recollection/reclaim: not executed

Formal store status:
- runs/amazon-price-store.json now has 10 trusted Amazon displayed-price records.
- Price formula readback passed for 10/10 ASINs with USD x 7 x 1.55.
- runs/aliexpress-evidence-store.json now has 3 records: 1 verified and 2 evidence_split.
- Verified category evidence currently exists only for B0DXFB86J7.

Pipeline after price/evidence:
- Total ASINs: 10
- Gate ready: 1
- Blocked: 9
- Ready for readonly edit preflight: B0DXFB86J7
- Blockers: category_evidence_missing=7, aliexpress_category_evidence_split=2

Edit/save/readback result for B0DXFB86J7:

- SKU/ASIN: B0DXFB86J7
- Price: CNY 108.39
- Stock: 15
- Wait-to-publish readback: pass
- Field mismatches: 0

Code finding:
- Browser live script during the run was still v2.1.4 and could reuse stale ASIN/price panel state.
- Source script was fixed to v2.1.5 in src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js.
- Fix scope: current edit ASIN source priority, Amazon price store read from browser cache, invisible locked required attributes no longer block by themselves.
- Syntax check passed for the updated source file.

Current stop point:
- First real product closed loop passed.
- AliExpress evidence was continued. `B0DPSJP47V` and `B0FH7774VK` were added as verified evidence records.
- New pipeline report: runs/dxm-batch-pipeline-first-batch-after-more-evidence-20260702.json and .md.
- Gate ready is now 3: B0DXFB86J7, B0DPSJP47V, B0FH7774VK.
- Blocked remains 7: category_evidence_missing=6 and aliexpress_category_evidence_split=1.
- B0DPSJP47V edit preflight was attempted with local runtime injection v2.1.6.
- B0DPSJP47V was not saved: title/category partially succeeded, but freight 111, required attributes, Ships From, price, and variation parameters were still blocked.
- Do not save B0DPSJP47V until the edit-page field-fill control issue after category modal / variation-parameter transition is fixed and preflight passes.
- Browser persistent Tampermonkey script may still be v2.1.4; source file is now v2.1.6 and must be deployed before broader live validation.

Current phase: Validation / first 10 real-ASIN batch control continuation

Amazon displayed-price readonly dry-run was completed for the first real batch:
- Input ASINs: runs/validation-100-first-batch-candidates-20260701.json
- First dry-run report: runs/amazon-displayed-price-dryrun-first-batch-20260702.json

- Captured: 10
- Failed: 0
- Price-store writes: 0
- Exception-queue writes: 0
- Formal amazon price store, AliExpress evidence store, and exception queue remain 0 business records

Price confidence:
- 9/10 ASINs were stable across the first two dry-runs.
- B0F1DDLKBB had one inconsistent repeat read: 19.99 from #corePriceDisplay_desktop_feature_div, then 18.99 from #desktop_buybox, then 19.99 again from #corePriceDisplay_desktop_feature_div.
- Recommended price-store value for B0F1DDLKBB is 19.99 because the core price selector was observed twice and the buybox-only 18.99 was the outlier.

Current stop point:
- Formal price-store write is recommended but not yet executed.
- Per project boundary, write contents must be reported before writing runs/amazon-price-store.json.
- AliExpress category evidence capture has not started yet in this continuation.
- No Dianxiaomi collection, claim, edit, save, move to wait-to-publish, publish, or one-click publish was executed.

Current phase: Validation / code-execution hardening for 100-category 100-product stress-test

First-batch pipeline plan was generated from the real 2026-07-01 validation batch:
- Input snapshot: runs/validation-100-first-batch-candidates-20260701.json
- JSON report: runs/dxm-batch-pipeline-first-batch-20260702.json
- Markdown report: runs/dxm-batch-pipeline-first-batch-20260702.md
- Schema: dxm-batch-pipeline-report-v1
- Total ASINs: 10
- Gate ready: 0
- Blocked: 10
- Main blockers: category_evidence_missing=10, amazon_displayed_price_missing=10
- Recommended order: recover trusted Amazon displayed prices first, then verify/import AliExpress category evidence
- Readonly edit preflight: 0 ASINs currently eligible
- Safety readback: businessActions=false, browserActions=false, writesExceptionQueue=false, writesPriceStore=false
- Formal amazon price store, AliExpress evidence store, and exception queue remain 0 records

Product risk filtering is now machine-coded at project level:
- Rules: config/product-risk-rules.json
- Tool: tools/product-risk-filter.js
- Batch gate integration: tools/dxm-batch-execution-gate.js --risk-file / --risk-json

Risk filter statuses:
- allow
- needs_review
- blocked

Covered machine categories:
- brand_logo_or_infringement_risk
- food_or_ingestible_risk
- liquid_cosmetic_or_chemical_risk
- medical_or_health_claim_risk
- children_or_toy_risk
- battery_or_electric_risk
- weapon_or_hazardous_material_risk
- adult_or_sensitive_risk
- fragile_or_glass_risk
- apparel_or_wearable_risk
- product_risk_record_missing

Validation:
- syntax checks passed
- safe kitchen strainer allowed
- food storage container false-positive guard passed
- edible candy / medical / IP + children + battery samples blocked
- temporary exception queue write/readback passed
- formal amazon price store, AliExpress evidence store, and exception queue remain 0 records

Boundary:
- no browser page action
- no Dianxiaomi collection, claim, edit, save, move to wait-to-publish, publish, or one-click publish
- no Product Development draft handling
```

Wait-to-publish batch readback is now strengthened:
- Tool: `tools/dxm-wait-publish-readback.js`
- Browser readback command remains `check`
- Local no-browser analysis command is now `analyze`
- Inputs can include saved `--readback-json` / `--readback-file`
- Expected values can be supplied with `--expected-json` / `--expected-file`

Field-level checks now report:
- row found / missing
- SKU contains expected ASIN/SKU
- price numeric match with tolerance
- stock match
- category leaf/equivalent term match

Important behavior:
- If a row is missing, the main blocker is `wait_publish_row_missing`; the tool no longer creates fake price/stock/category mismatches from the missing row.
- `not_wait_publish_page` and `wait_publish_page_not_loaded` are retryable wait-publish readback control issues.
- Formal stores remain unchanged unless `--write-exceptions` is explicitly used.

Batch exception reporting is now machine-coded:
- Tool: `tools/exception-queue.js report`
- JSON output is the default.
- Markdown output: `--format markdown`
- Optional file output: `--out <path>`

Report fields:
- total ASINs
- clear / blocked / control_retryable / needs_review counts
- open exceptions by reason/category/severity
- grouped next-action ASIN lists
- per-ASIN primary reason, category, severity, retryability, and next action

Exception queue writes now use a lightweight lock:
- protects read-modify-write operations during parallel tool execution
- prevents concurrent upserts from losing entries
- validation retained 5/5 concurrent temporary exception writes

Unified candidate manifest is now available:
- Tool: `tools/candidate-manifest.js`
- Schema: `dxm-candidate-manifest-v1`
- Default mode: dry-run
- Formal or file output requires `--write --out <path>`

The manifest gives every ASIN one standard row:
- Amazon title / URL / displayed price
- product family
- target platform/store/license metadata when supplied
- expected CNY price / stock / Origin / freight template
- lifecycle fields for collection, claim, edit, wait-publish, final status
- merged risk / price / AliExpress evidence / exception status
- `precheckRoutingStatus`
- `nextAction`

Routing statuses currently include:
- `auto_ready`
- `skip_risk_filter`
- `needs_review`
- `price_missing_or_invalid`
- `category_evidence_not_ready`
- exception-derived statuses such as `blocked` or `control_retryable`

Batch pipeline orchestration is now available:
- Tool: `tools/dxm-batch-pipeline.js`
- Schema: `dxm-batch-pipeline-report-v1`
- Commands: `plan` and `check`
- Default `plan`: local dry-run, no browser page opens
- `check`: local dry-run unless explicit readonly flags are supplied
- Explicit readonly flags: `--capture-missing-prices`, `--sync-evidence`, `--edit-preflight`, `--wait-readback`
- Report writes require `--write --out <path>`
- Price writes require `--capture-missing-prices --write-price-captures`
- Exception writes require `--write-exceptions` or `--write-price-capture-exceptions`

Pipeline output now combines:
- candidate manifest
- local gate
- optional check report
- final gate
- exception batch report
- summary counts
- next-action groups
- recommended execution order

Validation passed:
- syntax check
- help output
- local fixture `plan`
- local fixture `check`
- Markdown output
- temporary report write/readback
- risk-first recommended order
- formal amazon price store, AliExpress evidence store, and exception queue remain 0 records

Task screenshot cleanup is now project policy:
- Tool: `tools/cleanup-task-screenshots.js`
- Default command: `plan`
- Delete command: `cleanup --write`
- Default scope: root-level screenshots and `runs/**/*.png|jpg|jpeg|webp`
- Rule: screenshots are temporary evidence; unreferenced screenshots should be deleted after each task.
- Keep only screenshots explicitly referenced by reports/docs/JSON, such as recent failure scenes, page structure changes, key readback proof, or dangerous-action exclusion proof.
- Current dry-run found 153 image files and 153 cleanup candidates because none were explicitly referenced by project text files.

## Previous Live Update - 2026-07-01

```text
Current phase: Validation / 100-category 100-product stress-test first-batch claim completed; edit-save blocked by category evidence gate

Scope:
- Continued with WebBridge after user request.
- No new collection, no re-claim of already claimed products, no Product Development draft handling, no final publish, no one-click publish, and no product-level publish was executed.
- Goal remains edit/save to wait-to-publish only.

Live continuation result:
- Page script readback before claim: `DXM Amazon Crawlbox V1 v0.1.31`.
- Dianxiaomi collection page counts before claim: `全部(6513)`, `未认领(10)`, `已认领(6503)`.
- Current-batch visible rows: 9.
- Missing current-batch row remains `B0GFV4N3K8`.
- Old row `B07D5DN269` remained unchecked and was not claimed.
- Claim modal top tab stayed `全部`.
- Verified `Halo Home Store` was the concrete checkbox under the left-side `速卖通海外托管` group.
- Did not click the group `全选`.
- Readback before confirmation: `已选(1)`.
- Claim result: `速卖通海外托管采集认领执行完成，成功 9 条，失败 0 条，跳过重复数据 0 条`.
- Opened `速卖通海外托管 > 采集箱`.
- Authoritative collection-box readback: `采集箱(9)`, `发布中 (0)`, `发布失败 (0)`, `第1-9条，共 9 条记录`.

Edit/save continuation:
- `B0C1JY1C7F` / edit id `167487782009931687`:
  - Amazon displayed price USD readback: `$8.99`.
  - Expected goods value: `CNY 97.54`.
  - Not saved.
  - Blocked by `category_evidence_missing`; visible goods value still `74.51`; category and freight `111` not selected.
- `B01E2EYG4U` / edit id `167487782009931667`:
  - Amazon displayed price USD readback: `$19.96`.
  - Expected goods value: `CNY 216.57`.
  - Not saved.
  - Blocked by `category_evidence_missing`; visible goods value still `182.78`; category and freight `111` not selected; imported custom attributes still invalid.

Current blocker:
- The previous claim-flow blocker is resolved.
- The current blocker is edit-save gating: the verified AliExpress category evidence from the candidate phase is not available to the edit-page automation / learned rules for these products.
- Per price rule, Dianxiaomi visible old goods values cannot be used. Each product needs trusted Amazon displayed price USD before save.

Price-source terminology update:
- Current business rule uses Amazon page displayed price candidates, not stale Dianxiaomi imported prices or cached `originalPrice` fields.
- Open the Amazon product page and use the price displayed at that time. Valid candidates include current buy-box price, displayed ranges, variant prices, and strike/list prices such as `List Price`.
- By default, apply `highest_displayed_value` to valid displayed-price candidates; for example `$8.99 - $12.99` -> `$12.99`, and `Price $19.94 List Price: $20.99` -> `$20.99`.
- Price-store field compatibility is now implemented: `amazonDisplayedPriceUsd` is preferred, legacy `amazonOriginalPriceUsd` remains accepted, and summaries output both fields.
- CSV import accepts displayed-price headers and legacy original-price headers.

Amazon displayed-price capture step 3:
- Added readonly capture tool: `tools/amazon-displayed-price-capture.js`.
- `parse-text` supports single displayed price, `From $x.xx`, ranges, and List Price / strike-price evidence; candidate selection defaults to highest valid displayed value unless the current task explicitly overrides it.
- `capture` opens an Amazon product page through WebBridge and reads the displayed price area.
- Writes to the price store only with explicit `--write`.
- Live readonly verification on `B0D65JFRX4` succeeded. The Amazon price area included `$9.99` and list price `$11.99`; per the current displayed-price rule the captured value was `11.99`.
- Temporary price-store write/readback and gate integration passed; formal price/evidence/exception stores remain empty.

Amazon displayed-price capture failure step 4:
- `tools/exception-queue.js` now classifies Amazon price-capture failures.
- Standard reasons include `amazon_page_captcha_or_robot_check`, `amazon_product_unavailable_no_displayed_price`, `amazon_price_selector_missing`, `amazon_price_capture_failed`, and environment-control failures such as `webbridge_daemon_unreachable`.
- `tools/amazon-displayed-price-capture.js` now returns exception previews when capture fails.
- Exception queue writes require explicit `--write-exceptions`; price-store writes still require separate `--write`.
- Simulated failure wrote 1 item to `/private/tmp`; formal `runs/exception-queue.json` remains empty.
- Successful live Amazon capture path still returns no exception rows.

Amazon displayed-price batch step 5:
- Added generic batch capture entry: `tools/amazon-displayed-price-batch.js`.
- It processes ASINs sequentially and reuses one Amazon browser tab by default.
- Inputs: `--asins`, `--asin-file`, optional `--limit`, `--start-index`, and `--delay-ms`.
- Price writes require explicit `--write-prices`; exception writes require explicit `--write-exceptions`.
- The single-capture parser now supports localized Amazon USD text such as `17.99美元` / `17美元 . 99`, and filters non-price contexts such as sales counts, free-shipping thresholds, and promo credits before applying the current highest displayed-price rule.
- Live readonly verification passed on Amazon pages. `B0BY2M154R` no longer misreads `订单满35美元` as product price; when multiple variant prices are visible, the parser uses the highest displayed variant price per current rule.
- Temporary price-store write passed; formal `runs/amazon-price-store.json`, `runs/aliexpress-evidence-store.json`, and `runs/exception-queue.json` remain empty.

Batch gate price-capture integration step 6:
- `tools/dxm-batch-execution-gate.js plan` now includes `amazonPriceCapturePlan`.
- The plan automatically lists ASINs missing trusted Amazon displayed prices and returns copyable dry-run/write commands for `tools/amazon-displayed-price-batch.js`.
- `check --capture-missing-prices` can explicitly call the readonly batch price capture from the gate.
- Captured price writes require `--capture-missing-prices --write-price-captures`.
- Capture failure exception writes require `--capture-missing-prices --write-price-capture-exceptions`.
- Temporary write/readback through gate passed: after a temporary price write, the gate removed `amazon_displayed_price_missing` and left only `category_evidence_missing`.
- Formal `runs/amazon-price-store.json`, `runs/aliexpress-evidence-store.json`, and `runs/exception-queue.json` remain empty.

Code-execution hardening step 1:
- `DXM Amazon Crawlbox V1 v0.1.32` was installed and verified with readonly WebBridge JSON readback.
- The script now exposes `window.__DXM_AMAZON_CRAWLBOX_STATUS_READBACK__` and `#dxm-amazon-crawlbox-status-readback-json`.
- Readback confirmed current data-acquisition counts: `全部(6513)`, `未认领(1)`, `已认领(6512)`.
- The only visible unclaimed ASIN was old row `B07D5DN269`; it remained unchecked.
- Current-batch visible rows are now 0, so do not continue from the unclaimed list or click batch claim.
- In the current Codex sandbox, Node direct access to `127.0.0.1:10086` is blocked, but direct shell `curl` WebBridge calls work; use direct `curl` readback for live checks.

Code-execution hardening step 2:
- `DXM Amazon Crawlbox V1 v0.1.33` cleaned up readonly status wording by adding `publishControlVisible` while keeping legacy `publishVisible`.
- `DXM Amazon Crawlbox V1 v0.1.34` added generic `currentBatchSelectionPlan` and hardened current-batch selection.
- Selection readback now reports whether current-batch rows are visible/selectable, whether old/other rows are checked, which ASINs are missing, and whether selection can be attempted.
- The selection path now clears non-current checked rows before selecting current rows and blocks if old/other rows remain checked.
- No task-specific ASIN, store, count, or date is hardcoded in this code path.
- Live readonly verification on v0.1.34 returned `reason=current_batch_rows_not_visible` and `canAttemptSelection=false`, so the current unclaimed list remains unsafe for batch claim.

Code-execution hardening step 3.1 / 3.2:
- Added generic AliExpress evidence schema: `config/aliexpress-evidence.schema.json`.
- Added empty ASIN-level evidence store: `runs/aliexpress-evidence-store.json`.
- Added JavaScript read/write helper: `tools/aliexpress-evidence-store.js`.
- Tool supports `init`, `list`, `get`, `upsert`, and `mark` for evidence statuses such as `aliexpress_verified`, `evidence_missing`, and `evidence_split`.
- Verification used local syntax/JSON/temp-file tests only; no AliExpress or Dianxiaomi business page action was executed.
- Formal evidence store is currently empty, so edit-save category evidence gates remain unresolved until records are added or learned rules are connected.

Code-execution hardening step 3.3:
- Added AliExpress entry config: `config/aliexpress-entry.json`.
- Automation primary entry is `https://www.aliexpress.com/` in Google Chrome, using the current Chrome login state.
- Chrome bookmark-bar `速卖通` is recorded as manual fallback only, not the automation primary path.
- Added config checker: `tools/aliexpress-entry-check.js`.
- Allowed actions are limited to open/search/image-search/read category or similar-product evidence.
- Forbidden actions include order, cart, favorite, chat, account/payment/address changes, seller messaging, and personal-data form submission.
- Verification used local config checks and a live readonly WebBridge open of `https://www.aliexpress.com/`.
- Live readback confirmed page title loaded, search input was present, and logged-in account text `您好，ae165012 帐户` was visible.
- No AliExpress search, image search, product click, order, cart, favorite, chat, account/payment/address action, or personal-data submission was executed.

Code-execution hardening step 3.4:
- Prepared `DXM Automation V1 - NEW v2.1.3`.
- Edit-page preflight now reads ASIN-level AliExpress evidence from browser cache key `dxm_aliexpress_evidence_store_v1`, page global `window.__DXM_ALIEXPRESS_EVIDENCE_STORE__`, or DOM JSON node `#dxm-aliexpress-evidence-store-json`.
- Verified evidence records must have status `aliexpress_verified` or `learned_rule_matched` and a non-empty `dxmCandidateCategory` before they can become a Dianxiaomi category-modal plan.
- Existing learned category rules remain fallback evidence; missing/unverified/no-DXM-candidate records now produce explicit preflight blockers before save.
- Added browser-cache export helper: `tools/aliexpress-evidence-browser-cache.js`.
- Verification passed for syntax checks, formal empty-store inspection, temporary-store browser-cache export, and hardcoded-task scan.
- Formal evidence store is still empty, so live edit-save remains blocked until ASIN evidence records are added and synced to the browser cache.
- No Dianxiaomi collection, claim, edit save, wait-to-publish move, final publish, one-click publish, Product Development draft handling, or product-level publish was executed.

Code-execution hardening step 3.5:
- Prepared `DXM Automation V1 - NEW v2.1.4`.
- Added readonly edit-page preflight readback entry: `window.__DXM_AUTOMATION_V1_READONLY_PREFLIGHT__()`.
- Added DOM JSON node: `#dxm-automation-v1-readonly-preflight-json`.
- The readonly readback returns version, URL, product ID, ASIN, evidence-store status, category evidence, price, category, freight template, required attributes/Origin, publish-risk controls, blockers, `preflightPass`, and `safeToSaveToWaitPublish`.
- This readback does not run edit rules, click buttons, fill fields, save, move to wait-to-publish, publish, or one-click publish.
- Verification passed for syntax check and hardcoded-task scan.

Code-execution hardening step 3.6:
- Extended `tools/aliexpress-evidence-browser-cache.js` with WebBridge-backed `sync` and `read` commands.
- `sync` reads `runs/aliexpress-evidence-store.json`, builds the browser payload, finds or opens a Dianxiaomi page, and writes `localStorage.dxm_aliexpress_evidence_store_v1`.
- `read` reads the browser-side cache summary back without business-page actions.
- Formal evidence store currently has 0 records; browser cache sync therefore writes 0 records with schema `aliexpress-evidence-store-v1`.
- Readonly edit-page preflight after sync confirms the evidence store is now present (`ok=true`) while the current ASIN remains blocked as `category_evidence_missing`.
- Verification passed for syntax check, inspect, direct WebBridge sync, elevated Node tool sync, readonly preflight readback after sync, hardcoded-task scan, and network safety check.
- No Dianxiaomi collection, claim, field edit, edit save, wait-to-publish move, final publish, one-click publish, Product Development draft handling, or product-level publish was executed.

Code-execution hardening step 3.7:
- Added `tools/aliexpress-evidence-capture.js`.
- The tool supports:
  - `open`: open a readonly AliExpress search page from a query.
  - `capture`: read current AliExpress search-page titles and `postCategoryId` signals; it writes only when `--write` is passed.
  - `from-resolver`: import existing resolver JSON reports into the ASIN evidence store.
  - `manual`: write a manually verified evidence record.
- Safety rule in code: `aliexpress_verified` requires a DXM candidate category and strong enough evidence; split or low-confidence AliExpress signals become `evidence_split` / `needs_manual_review`, not verified.
- Live readonly capture successfully read AliExpress search results and `postCategoryId` signals without clicking products. The sample live search was conservatively classified as `evidence_split` because the category ID distribution was not strong enough in the current page snapshot.
- Temporary resolver/manual write tests passed in `/private/tmp`; formal `runs/aliexpress-evidence-store.json` remains empty.
- Network safety check showed 0 `save.json` / publish / online / offline / cart / order requests.
- No Dianxiaomi collection, claim, field edit, edit save, wait-to-publish move, final publish, one-click publish, Product Development draft handling, AliExpress product click, cart, order, chat, or form submission was executed.

Code-execution hardening step 3.8:
- Added generic AliExpress-to-Dianxiaomi category mapping config: `config/aliexpress-dxm-category-map.json`.
- Added mapping helper: `tools/aliexpress-dxm-category-map.js`.
- The mapping key is AliExpress `postCategoryId`; the output is a Dianxiaomi visible category path plus confidence/status/provenance.
- Initial active mapping: `postCategoryId=200231151` -> `家装（硬装）(Home Improvement)/厨房设施(Kitchen Fixture)/厨房水槽配件(Kitchen Sink Accessories)/厨房水槽水漏、过滤网(Kitchen Drains & Strainers)`.
- `tools/aliexpress-evidence-capture.js` now auto-fills `dxmCandidateCategory` from the active mapping when capture sees a mapped top category.
- Safety remains conservative: mapped category + weak/split AliExpress evidence still stays `evidence_split`; it is not promoted to `aliexpress_verified`.
- Verification passed for syntax checks, active mapping resolve, missing unmapped category behavior, strong-evidence auto-fill, split-evidence preservation, temporary resolver import, temporary evidence import, and formal evidence store readback.
- Formal `runs/aliexpress-evidence-store.json` remains empty.
- No Dianxiaomi collection, claim, field edit, edit save, wait-to-publish move, final publish, one-click publish, Product Development draft handling, AliExpress product click, cart, order, chat, or form submission was executed.

Code-execution hardening step 3.9:
- Added batch evidence tool: `tools/aliexpress-evidence-batch.js`.
- Commands:
  - `status`: read ASIN batch evidence state from the evidence store.
  - `import-resolvers`: convert resolver JSON files into evidence records; default is dry-run and formal writes require `--write`.
  - `summary`: summarize verified/blocker counts in a store.
- Resolver import now uses the category mapping support in `tools/aliexpress-evidence-capture.js`.
- Dry-run import of `runs/category-resolver/20260630-remaining3-poc` produced 3 importable records: 1 verified and 2 blockers.
- Temporary-store `--write` test wrote 3 records and read back 1 verified / 2 blockers.
- Formal `runs/aliexpress-evidence-store.json` remains empty.
- No browser page action, Dianxiaomi collection, claim, field edit, edit save, wait-to-publish move, final publish, one-click publish, Product Development draft handling, AliExpress product click, cart, order, chat, or form submission was executed.

Code-execution hardening step 3.10:
- Added closure tool: `tools/aliexpress-evidence-preflight-check.js`.
- Commands:
  - `local`: read project evidence store summary and optional ASIN batch status.
  - `sync-read`: sync evidence store into browser `localStorage.dxm_aliexpress_evidence_store_v1`, then read it back.
  - `preflight`: read `DXM Automation V1` readonly preflight from `window.__DXM_AUTOMATION_V1_READONLY_PREFLIGHT__()` or the DOM JSON node.
  - `check`: combine local status, optional `--sync`, and optional `--preflight`.
- Exported reusable WebBridge helpers from `tools/aliexpress-evidence-browser-cache.js`.
- Verification passed for syntax checks, local formal empty-store report, temporary-store report with 1 verified / 2 blockers, WebBridge sync/readback of the formal 0-record store, readonly preflight readback, and full `check --sync --preflight`.
- Current browser page is `https://www.dianxiaomi.com/web/smtlocalProduct/draft`, so readonly preflight correctly reports `not_edit_page`.
- Browser cache readback confirms schema `aliexpress-evidence-store-v1`, cache key `dxm_aliexpress_evidence_store_v1`, and record count `0`.
- Formal `runs/aliexpress-evidence-store.json` remains empty.
- No edit-rule click, Dianxiaomi collection, claim, field edit, edit save, wait-to-publish move, final publish, one-click publish, Product Development draft handling, AliExpress product click, cart, order, chat, or form submission was executed.

Code-execution hardening step 3.11:
- Hardened formal evidence-store imports in `tools/aliexpress-evidence-batch.js`.
- Dry-run `import-resolvers` now emits `confirmation.token` and suggested `writeArgs`.
- Writing the formal `runs/aliexpress-evidence-store.json` now requires:
  `--write --confirm-token <token-from-dry-run>`.
- Missing confirmation token is rejected before any formal write.
- Wrong confirmation token is rejected before any formal write.
- Temporary/custom stores remain writable without confirmation for test verification.
- Verification passed for syntax check, dry-run token generation, missing-token rejection, wrong-token rejection, temporary-store write/readback, and stable confirmation token across repeated runs.
- Current dry-run for `runs/category-resolver/20260630-remaining3-poc` reports 3 importable records: 1 verified and 2 blockers.
- Formal `runs/aliexpress-evidence-store.json` remains empty because no confirmed formal import was executed.
- No browser page action, Dianxiaomi collection, claim, field edit, edit save, wait-to-publish move, final publish, one-click publish, Product Development draft handling, AliExpress product click, cart, order, chat, or form submission was executed.

AliExpress evidence batch-ingestion closure:
- Added `closure` command to `tools/aliexpress-evidence-batch.js`.
- `closure` combines resolver import preview/write, ASIN evidence-store readback, effective evidence readiness, blockers, and next-action lists.
- Resolver compatibility improved: `recommended.dxmVisibleCategory` is now accepted as a DXM candidate category in addition to `recommended.dxmVisibleCategoryPath`.
- Verified on `runs/category-resolver/20260630-remaining3-poc`:
  - dry-run closure: 3 importable records, 2 verified, 1 `aliexpress_category_evidence_split`;
  - temporary-store write/readback: 3 written, 2 verified, 1 split;
  - formal-store write without confirmation token was rejected before write.
- Formal `runs/aliexpress-evidence-store.json` remains empty.
- No browser page action, Dianxiaomi collection, claim, field edit, edit save, wait-to-publish move, final publish, one-click publish, Product Development draft handling, AliExpress product click, cart, order, chat, or form submission was executed.

AliExpress-to-Dianxiaomi category mapping coverage:
- Enhanced `tools/aliexpress-dxm-category-map.js`.
- New commands:
  - `review-resolvers`: dry-run resolver directory/file analysis and mapping candidate report.
  - `import-resolvers`: dry-run by default; formal map writes require `--write --confirm-token <token>`.
  - `coverage`: reports whether resolver `postCategoryId` values are active/usable in the current map.
- Resolver imports now support both `recommended.dxmVisibleCategoryPath` and `recommended.dxmVisibleCategory`.
- Verification on `runs/category-resolver/20260630-remaining3-poc`:
  - current formal map coverage: 1 usable mapping (`200231151`), `211114` missing, cable clips split/blocked;
  - temporary map import wrote 2 active mappings: `200231151` and `211114 -> 笔筒(Pen Holders)`;
  - temporary coverage then showed 2 usable mappings and 1 blocked split row;
  - formal-map write without confirmation token was rejected.
- Formal `config/aliexpress-dxm-category-map.json` remains unchanged at 1 mapping.
- Formal `runs/amazon-price-store.json`, `runs/aliexpress-evidence-store.json`, and `runs/exception-queue.json` remain empty.

Code-execution hardening step 3.12:
- Added machine-readable exception queue file: `runs/exception-queue.json`.
- Added exception queue tool: `tools/exception-queue.js`.
- Supported commands:
  - `classify`: classify one blocker reason into queue fields.
  - `from-evidence-status`: convert ASIN evidence status into exception items; writes only with `--write`.
  - `from-preflight`: convert readonly preflight JSON blockers into exception items; writes only with `--write`.
  - `upsert`, `list`, `resolve`, `ignore`.
- Normalized blocker families include:
  - `category_evidence_missing`
  - `aliexpress_category_evidence_split`
  - `aliexpress_dxm_category_map_missing`
  - `amazon_original_price_missing`
  - `price_mismatch`
  - `required_attribute_incomplete`
  - `collection_missing_current_unclaimed_row`
  - `not_edit_page`
  - `environment_control_exception`
  - `brand_logo_or_infringement_risk`
- Verification passed for syntax check, empty formal queue listing, dry-run classification, dry-run formal evidence-status exception generation, temporary queue write/readback, readonly preflight JSON classification, and temporary queue resolve flow.
- Formal `runs/exception-queue.json` remains empty because no formal exception import was executed.
- No browser page action, Dianxiaomi collection, claim, field edit, edit save, wait-to-publish move, final publish, one-click publish, Product Development draft handling, AliExpress product click, cart, order, chat, or form submission was executed.

Code-execution hardening step 3.13:
- Added trusted Amazon displayed-price store: `runs/amazon-price-store.json`.
- Added price-store tool: `tools/amazon-price-store.js`.
- Supported commands:
  - `init`, `get`, `list`
  - `status`: batch-read trusted Amazon price status for ASINs.
  - `upsert`: write one verified price record.
  - `import-csv`: dry-run or write CSV price records.
  - `compute`: calculate expected CNY from runtime `--exchange-rate` and `--multiplier`.
- Price records currently store compatible field `amazonOriginalPriceUsd`, `currency`, `source`, `amazonUrl`, `evidenceUrl`, `status`, `reason`, and optional price range; business meaning is now Amazon page displayed price until the field migration is completed.
- Task formula is not hardcoded into the store; expected CNY is calculated from runtime formula inputs.
- `tools/exception-queue.js` now supports `from-price-status`.
- Price blockers routed into exception queue include `amazon_original_price_missing`, `amazon_original_price_out_of_range`, and `price_formula_missing_exchange_rate_or_multiplier`.
- Verification passed for syntax checks, formal empty-store status, temporary trusted-price upsert, expected CNY calculation, out-of-range classification, CSV dry-run, temporary CSV write/readback, and price-status exception queue conversion.
- Formal `runs/amazon-price-store.json` remains empty because no formal price import was executed.
- Formal `runs/exception-queue.json` remains empty.
- No browser page action, Dianxiaomi collection, claim, field edit, edit save, wait-to-publish move, final publish, one-click publish, Product Development draft handling, AliExpress product click, cart, order, chat, or form submission was executed.

Price-source field compatibility step 2:
- `tools/amazon-price-store.js` now prefers `amazonDisplayedPriceUsd` and falls back to `amazonOriginalPriceUsd`.
- Upsert and CSV import normalize records to include both fields for compatibility.
- `tools/exception-queue.js` recognizes `amazon_displayed_price_missing`.
- `tools/dxm-batch-execution-gate.js` and `tools/dxm-wait-publish-readback.js` now use the displayed-price missing reason.
- Temporary verification covered new-only, old-only, and both-field records; when both fields exist, the new displayed-price field wins.
- Formal `runs/amazon-price-store.json`, `runs/aliexpress-evidence-store.json`, and `runs/exception-queue.json` remain empty.

Code-execution hardening step 3.14:
- Added readonly wait-to-publish readback checker: `tools/dxm-wait-publish-readback.js`.
- The tool opens/verifies `https://www.dianxiaomi.com/web/smtlocalProduct/offline`.
- It reads target ASIN rows and checks SKU, expected CNY price, expected stock, and optional category terms.
- Expected price comes from `runs/amazon-price-store.json` plus runtime `--exchange-rate` and `--multiplier`; no task formula is hardcoded into the tool.
- Optional category expectation comes from `runs/aliexpress-evidence-store.json` or explicit `--expected-category`.
- Exception queue writes are disabled by default and require explicit `--write-exceptions`.
- `tools/exception-queue.js` now classifies `wait_publish_row_missing`, `wait_publish_sku_missing`, `wait_publish_price_mismatch`, `wait_publish_stock_mismatch`, and `wait_publish_category_mismatch`.
- Live readonly verification reached `/web/smtlocalProduct/offline`, confirmed page load, and read `第1-26条，共 26 条记录`.
- Temporary queue verification wrote 4 wait-publish blockers to `/private/tmp`; formal `runs/exception-queue.json` remains empty.
- No Dianxiaomi collection, claim, field edit, edit save, wait-to-publish move, final publish, one-click publish, Product Development draft handling, AliExpress product click, cart, order, chat, or form submission was executed.

Code-execution hardening step 3.15:
- Added generic current-batch execution gate: `tools/dxm-batch-execution-gate.js`.
- `plan` runs local-only gates: AliExpress evidence status + Amazon trusted price/formula status + per-ASIN next action.
- `check` can additionally run readonly browser evidence sync, readonly edit-page preflight, readonly wait-to-publish readback, and optional exception-queue writes.
- Default behavior is dry-run; exception queue writes require explicit `--write-exceptions`.
- The gate does not collect, claim, edit fields, save, move products, publish, one-click publish, delete, order, cart, chat, or submit forms.
- Verification passed with empty formal stores, temporary pass/block fixture, temporary exception-queue write/readback, formal queue unchanged, and hardcoded-task scan.
- This makes the current batch path more code-driven: evidence check -> price check -> edit preflight -> wait-publish readback -> exception queue.

Updated resume point:
- Resume from `速卖通海外托管 > 采集箱(9)`.
- Do not re-collect or re-claim this first batch.
- Continue with the remaining 7 only after adding per-ASIN AliExpress category evidence or a verified learned rule to `runs/aliexpress-evidence-store.json`, syncing evidence into the browser cache, and reading per-ASIN Amazon displayed price USD.
- Products with `category_evidence_missing` should enter the exception queue instead of repeated save attempts.
- Run report updated: `runs/validation-100-live-execution-20260701-claim-blocked.md`.

Current phase: Validation / 100-category 100-product stress-test claim-flow correction prepared

Scope:
- Real Validation execution was started after user authorization.
- Dianxiaomi collection was executed for the first 10-item batch; claim confirmation, edit, save, wait-to-publish move, final publish, and one-click publish were not executed.
- Product Development draft handling was not executed.
- The run stopped before clicking claim-modal `确定` because the assistant-side claim flow incorrectly treated the concrete store display name (`Halo Home Store`) as the primary target and then clicked/searched the top `速卖通海外托管` tab. User clarified the correct business flow: keep the modal top tab on `全部`, find the left-side `速卖通海外托管` group, tick the concrete store checkbox under that group regardless of store display name, read back `已选(1)`, then click `确定`.
- `DXM Amazon Crawlbox V1 v0.1.31` is prepared to overwrite the old logic. It selects the concrete checkbox inside the `速卖通海外托管` group container, does not use store-name search as the main path, does not click the top `速卖通海外托管` filter tab, and blocks if `已选(0)` remains after the checkbox is checked.
- Added the preflight confirmation checklist and 100-product list template in `docs/validation-100-preflight-confirmation.md`.
- User confirmed the 100-category stress-test business parameters and they were recorded in `TASK.md`, `docs/validation-100-preflight-confirmation.md`, and `docs/validation-100-category-100-product-plan.md`.

Live run result:
- Amazon raw candidate records scanned: 1512.
- Initial auto_ready: 91.
- Strict auto_ready after brand/title tightening: 44.
- AliExpress evidence verified: 44 / 44.
- First Dianxiaomi collection batch attempted: 10 ASINs.
- New current-batch unclaimed rows visible: 9.
- Missing current-batch row: `B0GFV4N3K8`.
- Selected for claim: 9 current-batch rows.
- Skipped old unclaimed row: `B07D5DN269`, unchecked by readback.
- Claim modal blocker reclassified: old v0.1.30 flow used the wrong modal navigation/selection model. Correct next action is to install v0.1.31, reopen batch claim from the existing 9 selected current-batch rows if still present, keep `全部`, tick the `速卖通海外托管` group store, read back `已选(1)`, then confirm.
- Saved to wait-to-publish: 0.
- Run report: `runs/validation-100-live-execution-20260701-claim-blocked.md`.

Source prepared after correction:
- `DXM Amazon Crawlbox V1 v0.1.31`.
- Claim modal selection now follows `全部 -> 速卖通海外托管 group -> concrete store checkbox -> 已选(1) -> 确定`.
- Store display name is optional/diagnostic; lack of an exact `Halo Home Store` text match is no longer a blocker when the required group contains one concrete store checkbox.
- The recovery still refuses `全选` as a substitute and still blocks Product Development / Draft / wrong-channel selections.

Confirmed Validation parameters:
- Task: 100品类压测.
- Platform/store/license: 速卖通海外托管 / Halo Home Store / A1.
- Goal: edit/save to wait-to-publish only; no publish and no one-click publish.
- Source: Amazon search; new collection and claim are allowed after live start confirmation.
- Sample: 100 products, one per category, Amazon displayed price USD 5-20.
- Price: the current 100-category task uses Amazon displayed price USD x 7 x 1.55 after default highest valid displayed-price candidate selection; valid candidates include current price, ranges, variants, and List Price / strike prices. This is task configuration, not a global formula.
- Category: AliExpress evidence required; safe adjacent DXM category allowed.
- Risk exclusions: brand/logo, food, medical, children, electric/battery, infringement high risk, missing displayed price, unclear main image, and over-complex variations.
- Execution gate: pre-judgment routing first; only `auto_ready` products proceed.
- Failure/readback: failed products enter an exception queue with field-level reasons; every save must be confirmed in the wait-to-publish list.

Rule library deposited:
- Required Ant/select dropdowns: search inputs are filters only; real option click + selected-label readback is required. Function / Use / Feature read recommended options first, clear `暂无数据` search filters, avoid Enter/Tab on dynamic dropdowns, retry numeric/internal-ID readback with click-only commit, and allow `Other/其他` as a legal fallback unless it is clearly wrong.
- Category: AliExpress/similar-product/verified DXM evidence is required; exact DXM leaf text is not mandatory when a safe adjacent category has the same use/form and no obvious mismatch. DOM click failure on a visible category result can be recovered with real coordinate double-click plus main-form readback.
- Native save: script preflight does not equal native pass. Native `请选择产品属性` requires exact field repair. Checkbox/radio groups must use real checked-state readback. Use / Feature / Plastic Type / Theme / Product application scenarios are documented as native-exposed blockers.
- Price: goods value can only come from current-task Amazon displayed price USD, task exchange rate, multiplier or tiered multiplier, rounding rule, and displayed-price candidate policy. Old DXM prices, cached prices, minPrice/maxPrice, non-Amazon UI scans, and manual CNY overrides are forbidden. Visible/SKU price mismatch blocks save and abnormal prices need pre-publish review.
- WebBridge/tab-control: evaluate hangs, navigation/closed targets, stale tab matches, screenshot/DOM timeouts, and stale dropdown overlays are environment control exceptions, not business failures. Save navigation to offline is a success path; use direct edit URLs and offline/draft authoritative readback.

Current phase: Recovery / 20-category collection-box remainder closed

Source prepared:
- `DXM Automation V1 - NEW v2.1.2`

Latest source correction:
- Use and Feature are now explicit required-attribute steps and preflight readback fields.
- Native page validation text `请选择产品属性` blocks preflight even when the script's mapped fields look complete.
- Feature no longer treats acrylic/plastic as BPA-free evidence by itself. Select BPA-free only when source evidence says BPA-free; otherwise choose a safe real visible option such as `Other/其他` when it commits.

Latest live recovery:
- User confirmed Tampermonkey overwrite and authorized a two-minute continuation from the existing collection box.
- Remaining collection-box product `B08PB79YXV` / edit id `167487782008788157` was completed to wait-to-publish.
- No recollection, no reclaim, no Product Development draft handling, no final publish, and no one-click publish was executed.
- Category `化妆品收纳盒(Makeup Organizers)` required real coordinate double-click on the exact search-result row before the main form wrote back the category.
- Script preflight then passed, but native save exposed additional required `用途(Use)` and `特性(Feature)` errors. These were repaired with real dropdown selections: Use `其他(others)`, Feature `其他(Other)`.
- The product was saved with freight template `111`, goods value `CNY 72.26`, stock `15`, SKU `B08PB79YXV`, Ships From United States, and category `化妆品收纳盒(Makeup Organizers)`.
- Authoritative readback at `/web/smtlocalProduct/offline`: `采集箱(0)`, `第1-26条，共 26 条记录`, `发布中 (0)`, `发布失败 (0)`, and B08 is present in wait-to-publish.

Previous source correction:
- Function / Use / Feature required dropdowns now follow the simplest workflow: open dropdown -> do not type by default -> read Dianxiaomi recommended visible options -> click the safest real option -> read back selected label.
- Search/filter is only a fallback when the recommended list has no safe visible option.
- v1.1.104's no Enter/Tab commit and numeric/internal-ID retry remain active.

Previous source correction:
- `23399620951` is a backend option value/id for the B08 `功能(Function)` dynamic attribute option, not a valid selected label.
- Root cause is submit method: the script clicked a real option, then Enter/Tab keyboard confirmation caused DXM/Ant to display the backend ID instead of the label.
- v1.1.104 makes Function/Use/Feature dynamic dropdowns click-only after selecting a real option; no Enter/Tab confirmation.
- If a dynamic dropdown still reads back a pure numeric/internal ID, v1.1.104 clears the field and retries once with click-only commit.

Previous source correction:
- User screenshot corrected the Function failure interpretation: when a search term such as `Storage` remains in the dropdown search box and the menu shows `暂无数据`, the next step is not field failure.
- Correct step: delete/clear the dropdown search text, let Dianxiaomi recommended options reappear, then choose the safest real visible option from those recommendations.
- v1.1.103 now clears no-result search filters and tries safe visible-option fallback before recording `product_attribute_dropdown_selection_failed`.
- Latest 2-minute live retry after user installed v1.1.103: category writeback succeeded via real coordinate double-click, but `功能(Function)` again became unsafe internal ID `23399620951`; focused clear/reopen did not expose recommended `.ant-select-item-option` values. Preflight did not pass and the product was not saved.

Latest live retry:
- User confirmed Tampermonkey overwrite, then authorized continuing remaining collection-box products within 5 minutes.
- Opened existing draft edit page only: B08PB79YXV / edit id `167487782008788157`.
- No recollection, reclaim, Product Development draft handling, final publish, one-click publish, or save with failed preflight was executed.
- Page script confirmed: `DXM Automation V1 V1.1.102`.
- Category modal search found `化妆品收纳盒(Makeup Organizers)`. Script DOM click did not write back at first, but a real coordinate double-click on the search-result row successfully wrote the category back to the main form.
- After rerunning edit rules, category, Brand, freight template `111`, Ships From United States, Color MULTI, supply price `CNY 72.26`, custom attributes, marketing images, and description checks were in place.
- The v1.1.102 live blocker was `功能(Function)`: v1.1.102 first selected a real option object but the page displayed internal ID `23399620951`; after clearing the field, the Function dropdown/search path showed `暂无数据`. User screenshot later clarified that a typed search term can hide Dianxiaomi recommended options, so this is now fixed in v1.1.103 by clearing the search term before failure.
- Because preflight still failed (`required attributes incomplete: high_concerned_chemical, origin, material` and Function had no safe selected label), the product was not saved or moved to wait-to-publish.

User correction:
- `Other/其他` is a valid option when it is visible and can be truly submitted.
- For `Feature` / `Function` / `Use`, the goal is not perfect semantic wording; the goal is a real, safe, non-obviously-wrong option that submits.
- Field type must be distinguished first: ordinary input fields can be typed according to their rules, but dropdown-field inputs are only search/filter boxes and must end with a real page option selected.
- Do not block a product just because a prettier exact option exists but is hard to commit. Try the exact/safe option first, then quickly fall back to `Other/其他` if it is visible and accepted.

General rule deposited:
- Required generic dropdowns use this priority:
  1. exact obvious option from product evidence and visible options;
  2. safe common option such as `Multiple Uses`, `Reusable`, or similar only when product evidence supports it;
  3. `Other/其他` as a legal fallback;
  4. skip only when no real option can be committed or the only visible options are obviously wrong.
- Obvious wrong options remain blocked, e.g. do not choose `Adjustable Size` for a fixed-size jar unless source evidence says adjustable.

Code change:
- Unknown required `Feature` candidate generation is now evidence-based rather than one-category-only:
  - qtip / cotton swab / acrylic / plastic context can try `无BPA塑料(Bpa-free plastic)`;
  - waterproof/reusable/multiple-use/adjustable candidates are added only when source evidence supports them;
  - `Other/其他` remains the final fallback.
- v1.1.100 current-field active-dropdown binding remains in place.

Verification:
- `node --check src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js` passed.
- No Dianxiaomi collection, reclaim, save, wait-to-publish move, final publish, one-click publish, or Product Development draft action was executed during this deposition.

Result of this continuation:
- Saved to wait-to-publish: 2 / 3 in this execution window
- Remaining unresolved: 1 / 3
- Forbidden actions executed: none
- WebBridge / tab-control interruption: yes, WebBridge evaluate/dropdown-control hangs and stale Ant dropdown overlays occurred during B08 field recovery; direct edit URLs/new tabs remained stable and no wrong-tab business action was observed.

Product outcomes:
- B0DQ3X91R7 / desk drawer organizer:
  - Stable edit id: 167487782008788133
  - Status: saved_to_wait_publish
  - Category: 收纳盒和收纳箱(Storage Boxes & Bins)
  - Key fields: freight template 111, goods value CNY 72.26, stock 15, SKU B0DQ3X91R7, Ships From United States.
  - Native save blocker repaired: Plastic Type was required after Material=Plastic, and package-sale/打包出售 had to be confirmed unchecked before save.
  - Success evidence: success modal `产品已移入待发布，请在「待发布」中查看！`; wait-to-publish readback contains B0DQ3X91R7.
- B08PB79YXV / cotton swab holder:
  - Stable edit id: 167487782008788157
  - Status: skipped
  - Category selected: 化妆品收纳盒(Makeup Organizers)
  - Completed fields before stop: Brand NONE, Use `其他(others)`, Function `其他(Other)`, High-concerned chemical `天然未处理(None)`, Origin `美国(Origin)(US(Origin))`, Material `亚克力(Acryl)`.
  - Failed field: 特性(Feature)
  - Field-level reason: `product_attribute_dropdown_selection_failed`; after 3 focused attempts, the Feature combobox stayed at `请选择` / `请选择产品属性`. Its own active dropdown did not render visible real options; JS input, keyboard accept, and CDP trusted input did not commit a selected label. The product was not saved.
- B0DFPHVNHG / silicone trivet mats / pot holders:
  - Stable edit id: 167487782008788277
  - Status: saved_to_wait_publish
  - Category: 餐垫(Placemats), selected as safe adjacent DXM category after clear AliExpress silicone hot-pad / pot-holder / trivet evidence and no exact DXM Pot Holders/Trivets leaf.
  - Key fields: Theme `其他(Other)`, Product application scenarios `厨房(Kitchen)` + `餐桌用(Dining table)`, Brand NONE, High-concerned chemical `天然未处理(None)`, Origin `美国(Origin)(US(Origin))`, Material `其他 (自行填写)(Other)`, Ships From United States, Color MULTI, freight template 111, goods value CNY 72.26, stock 15, SKU B0DFPHVNHG.
  - PC description was rewritten with product images first; 4 images retained and about 1238 visible English characters.
  - Success evidence: success modal `产品已移入待发布，请在「待发布」中查看！`; wait-to-publish readback shows B0DFPHVNHG row with category 餐垫(Placemats), CNY 72.26, stock 15.

New reusable findings:
- Native save can expose category-specific required checkbox groups after script/page preflight, e.g. Placemats requires Theme and Product application scenarios. Treat these as repairable native-save field blockers, not product failure.
- Required Material can be a checkbox group instead of an Ant select. For Placemats without Silicone, choose the safest real option `其他 (自行填写)(Other)` rather than forcing PVC/cotton/metal.
- For B08 Makeup Organizers, Feature dropdown remains the blocker when the field's own option list does not render; stale overlay options from other fields must not be used as evidence of completion.

Current phase: Debug / old-path cleanup before remaining-3 execution

Source prepared:
- `DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.100`

Hard fixes:
- Generic select helper now delegates to the locked real-option dropdown selector; old keyboard/text-entry select path is no longer an independent route.
- Postage fallback no longer searches all visible page options; it is anchored to the current postage dropdown.
- Generated save payloads force no package sale: `packageType=0`, `lotNum=''`.
- After each product is saved, skipped, or blocked, close that edit tab. Do not accumulate old edit pages.
- No Dianxiaomi business action or save was executed during this fix.

Current phase: Debug / edit-page safety hotfix before remaining-3 execution

Source prepared:
- `DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.99`

Hard fixes:
- Dropdown options must come from the current field's nearest active dropdown, not the first visible page option.
- Required select readback showing pure numeric/internal IDs or `请选择` is unsafe and blocks save.
- `销售方式/打包出售` must remain unchecked; if already checked the script cancels it, and preflight blocks if it remains checked.
- No Dianxiaomi business action or save was executed during this fix.

Current phase: Debug / Recovery rule optimization for remaining-3 continuation

User correction applied:
- Red-star required dropdowns must choose real dropdown options; typed input is not a submitted value.
- AliExpress evidence constrains the product family, but Dianxiaomi category selection may use a safe adjacent visible category when no exact leaf exists.
- For silicone heat-resistant pot holders / trivet mats, `餐垫(Placemats)` is the preferred safe adjacent DXM category over `杯垫(Coaster)` or `茶壶底座(Teapot Trivets)` when exact `隔热垫/锅垫/Pot Holders/Trivets` is unavailable.

Source prepared:
- `DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.98`
- No Dianxiaomi collection, reclaim, save, wait-to-publish move, publish, one-click publish, or Product Development draft action was executed during this source/rule update.

Key script changes:
- Category rules now include `silicone-trivet-placemats-adjacent-dxm`.
- Category resolver rules were synced from `skills/category-resolver/learned_rules.json` into the userscript.
- Required Ant/select dropdown handling now opens the target dropdown and reads the unfiltered visible option list before searching typed values.
- `Frame Material`, `Function`, `Material`, and unknown required dropdown fields can choose the safest real visible option when exact candidates are absent, then require selected-label readback.

Next execution target:
- Continue existing collection-box drafts only: `B0DQ3X91R7`, `B08PB79YXV`, `B0DFPHVNHG`.
- Retry only after installing v1.1.98 in Tampermonkey.
- Save/move to wait-to-publish only after preflight passes.

Product outcomes:
- B0DQ3X91R7 / desk drawer organizer:
  - Stable edit id: 167487782008788133
  - Category correction: v1.1.97 first selected wrong broad-search result `电池收纳盒(Battery Storage Boxes)` from `收纳盒`; manually corrected to `收纳盒和收纳箱(Storage Boxes & Bins)`.
  - Completed: title brand cleanup removed `Shenee`, custom attributes cleared, freight 111 selected, goods value CNY 72.26, US ships-from visible.
  - Failed field: `框架材质(Frame Material)` / material-family required dropdown.
  - Evidence: page showed red-star Frame Material with validation `请选择产品属性`; stale `塑料(Plastic)` could be cleared, but searching `Metal` / `金属` rendered no real option objects and keyboard accept did not commit a selected label.
  - Status: skipped, `product_attribute_dropdown_selection_failed`.
- B08PB79YXV / cotton swab holder:
  - Stable edit id: 167487782008788157
  - Category correction: v1.1.97 found the correct `化妆品收纳盒(Makeup Organizers)` result but did not write it back; manually selected exact leaf successfully.
  - Completed: category selected, Brand NONE selected, freight 111 selected, goods value CNY 72.26, US ships-from visible.
  - Failed field: `功能(Function)` required dropdown; after opening and searching `Other`, no real option objects rendered and keyboard accept did not commit a selected label.
  - Preflight also still reported high-concerned chemical, Origin, and Material missing because the pipeline stopped at Function.
  - Status: skipped, `product_attribute_dropdown_selection_failed`.
- B0DFPHVNHG / silicone trivet mats / pot holders:
  - Stable edit id: 167487782008788277
  - AliExpress evidence completed before DXM category search. Similar results consistently showed silicone heat-resistant trivet mats, pot holders, hot pads, coasters, placemats, and kitchen heat mats.
  - DXM category searches: `隔热垫` no result, `锅垫` no result, `杯垫` returned `杯垫(Coaster)`, `餐垫` returned `餐垫(Placemats)` / `餐垫套装(Placemats Set)`, `Pot Holders` no result, `Trivet` returned `茶壶底座(Teapot Trivets)`.
  - Decision: adjacent categories are not safe exact matches for silicone hot pads / pot holders; no save.
  - Status: skipped, `dxm_visible_category_not_found` after clear AliExpress evidence.

New reusable findings:
- Drawer organizer learned rule must search exact `收纳盒和收纳箱` / `Storage Boxes & Bins` before broad `收纳盒`, because broad search can hit `电池收纳盒(Battery Storage Boxes)`.
- Cotton swab holder learned rule should search `化妆品收纳盒` / `Makeup Organizers` before `棉签盒`.
- Red-star Ant dropdown failure is valid only when no real `.ant-select-item-option` renders after clearing stale overlays, clearing/deleting any search text that caused `暂无数据`, and re-reading Dianxiaomi recommended options; typed search text is not completion.
- Silicone trivet / pot holder category has a new safe-adjacent solution after user correction: use `餐垫(Placemats)` when no exact hot-pad / pot-holder / trivet leaf is visible; avoid `Coaster` and `Teapot Trivets` unless product evidence is cup-only or teapot-only.

- Completed in the 17-draft recovery: B0D8W72LHR, B0FHPSJN7R, B0C6PDLYHF, B0C1G78CY2, B0DWDVSNX3, B0DXFJW9SJ, B0G1BKHG2J, B0FVXMVDMG, B0DL9VHZ14, B0B93HTY9Y, B0BJZDJ25F, B0D8T9TBVZ, B0H25DKDPS
- Completed in remaining-4 recovery: B0B2DH7J1Y
- No final publish or one-click publish was executed.

Still in collection box / unresolved:
- B0B2DH7J1Y / cabinet door bumpers:
  - status: success modal observed, `产品已移入待发布，请在「待发布」中查看！`
  - category: 柜门消音垫(Cabinet Bumpers)
  - preflight: passed with `risks=[]`
  - key fields: Brand `NONE`, High-concerned chemical `天然未处理(None)`, Origin `美国(Origin)(US(Origin))`, Material `塑料(Plastic)`, Ships From `美国(United States)`, freight template `111`, goods value `CNY 72.26`
  - note: `Number of Pcs` was not used as a blocker
- B0DFPHVNHG / silicone pot holders:
  - failed field: category
  - search attempts: 隔热垫, 锅垫, Pot Holders
  - corrected status: needs_aliexpress_category_verification
  - correction: previous `dxm_visible_category_not_found` was invalid because no AliExpress evidence object or success-verified learned rule was recorded before the Dianxiaomi searches
  - next action: run AliExpress image/similar-product category verification first; only after clear evidence may DXM category search fail as `dxm_visible_category_not_found`
- B0DQ3X91R7 / desk drawer organizer:
  - category selected: 收纳盒和收纳箱(Storage Boxes & Bins)
  - completed: title cleanup, custom attributes deletion, freight 111, price CNY 97.54, stock 15, SKU, PC description
  - failed fields: 框架材质(Frame Material), 功能(Function)
  - skip reason: product_attribute_dropdown_selection_failed after 3 attempts
  - corrected workflow: these fields are red-star required dropdowns; the dropdown input is only for search/filtering, and the field is valid only after a real page option is clicked and a selected label/item is read back
  - next action: install v1.1.97, then retry with verified category evidence + v1.1.96 real-option dropdown flow; Frame Material should prefer metal/steel/iron/alloy evidence for the metal mesh drawer organizer, Function should prefer storage/organizer/office before Other
- B08PB79YXV / cotton swab holder:
  - category selected: 化妆品收纳盒(Makeup Organizers)
  - completed: category, price CNY 63.91, stock 15, freight 111, SKU, PC description, visible base attributes
  - failed fields: 用途(Use), 功能(Function), 特性(Feature)
  - skip reason: product_attribute_dropdown_selection_failed after 3 attempts
  - next action: install v1.1.97, then retry with verified category evidence + real-option dropdown flow

Reusable category evidence confirmed:
- B0DL9VHZ14 / plant saucer tray -> 花盆托盘(Pot Trays)
- B0B93HTY9Y / refrigerator organizer bins -> 食品保鲜盒(Food Storage Container)
- B0BJZDJ25F / makeup brush holder -> 化妆刷收纳(Makeup Brush Storage)
- B0D8T9TBVZ / toilet paper holder stand -> 纸巾架(Paper Holders)
- B0H25DKDPS / laundry lint catcher -> 洗衣球,洗衣片(Laundry Balls & Discs)
- B08PB79YXV / cotton swab holder -> 化妆品收纳盒(Makeup Organizers), but native required attribute dropdowns still blocked save

Efficiency findings:
- Highest-time-cost step: AliExpress evidence + DXM category modal search + native Ant dropdown recovery.
- WebBridge / tab-control issue still exists: find_tab matched older edit tabs; direct new edit URL tabs were stable.
- Category result DOM click remained unstable; page-dispatched mousedown/click/dblclick on the exact result row was more reliable than plain DOM click and sometimes more reliable than CDP double-click.
- Native attribute dropdown inputs are search/filter boxes, not ordinary value fields; success must be verified by selected-label readback, native save, or visible error disappearance.
- Source optimization prepared: `DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.96` adds explicit `Frame Material` and `Function` real-option dropdown handling and rejects input-text-only completion for locked required dropdown fields.

Next state:
- Do not start a new 30-product validation unless user explicitly authorizes it.
- Current batch has 4 unresolved drafts in 采集箱(4).
- `B0B2DH7J1Y` is no longer blocked by `Number of Pcs`; it should be retried under the non-red-star variation skip rule.
- The remaining true blockers are `B0DFPHVNHG` missing AliExpress category evidence, `B0DQ3X91R7` required native dropdown selection, and `B08PB79YXV` required native dropdown selection.
- Source optimization prepared: `DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.95` adds a hard category-evidence gate; no DXM category search or `dxm_visible_category_not_found` classification is legal without clear AliExpress evidence or a matching success-verified learned rule.
- Latest source prepared after attribute review: `DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.96`; install before retrying B0DQ3X91R7 / B08PB79YXV required dropdown repair.
- Latest source prepared during remaining-4 recovery: `DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.97`; adds active evidence-backed category rules for `drawer-organizer-storage-boxes-visible-dxm` and `qtip-makeup-organizers-visible-dxm`. The script was copied to clipboard for Tampermonkey overwrite; live install still pending user confirmation.

Previous latest update:

```text
Current phase: Recovery / 17 remaining drafts execution blocked by script activation

User-authorized target:
- Continue the existing 20-category batch from the 17 Halo Home Store drafts.
- No recollection, no reclaim, no final publish, no one-click publish.
- Apply the three-step principle: confirm blocker -> fix minimally -> verify; stop after 3 failed attempts for the same blocker.

Live execution performed:
- `B0B2DH7J1Y` / cabinet door bumpers:
  - Category `柜门消音垫(Cabinet Bumpers)` was selected successfully by real double-click on the category search result.
  - Historical correction: the previous `number_of_pcs_option_missing_200` failure classification was wrong because `Number of Pcs` has no visible red `*`.
  - Correct rule: leave `Number of Pcs` blank unless native save explicitly reports that field as required.
- `B0FHPSJN7R` / cable organizer clips:
  - Category `桌面理线器(Cable Organizers)` was selected successfully.
  - Brand, high-concerned chemical, origin, US ships-from, white color, price `CNY 56.20`, stock `15`, and SKU `B0FHPSJN7R` were manually recoverable.
  - Skipped before save after 3 freight-template attempts because direct `111` search returned stale/empty dropdown states.
  - Later reusable finding: freight dropdown must be cleared and read as a full list before choosing exact `111`.
- `B0D8W72LHR` / rotating pen holder:
  - Category `笔筒(Pen Holders)` was selected successfully by real double-click.
  - Required attributes, US ships-from, white color, freight `111`, price `CNY 57.40`, stock `15`, SKU `B0D8W72LHR`, weight/dimensions, and PC description were recoverable.
  - Three native save attempts did not produce `产品已移入待发布`.
  - Remaining field-level blocker: Dianxiaomi custom-attribute row validation persisted after clearing/deleting rows, ending with 1 visible `自定义属性值不能超过70个字符！`.
  - Field-level failure: `custom_attribute_validation_persisted`.

Completed to wait-to-publish in this continuation:
- `0 / 17` confirmed.
- Authoritative readback: `/web/smtlocalProduct/offline` still shows `第1-9条，共 9 条记录`; `B0B2DH7J1Y`, `B0FHPSJN7R`, and `B0D8W72LHR` are not present.
- No final publish or one-click publish executed.

Systemic blocker found:
- Installed live script still blocks the edit pipeline at category when `REQUIRE_ALIEXPRESS_CATEGORY_EVIDENCE` is true, even after a verified category has already been written back.
- Stale panel/source-price value can override the current task source price.
- Custom attribute clearing needs robust row deletion, not only input clearing.

Source optimization prepared:
- `src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js`
- Version prepared: `DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.94`
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node.
- New source has been copied to clipboard for Tampermonkey overwrite.

Source changes:
- Trusted current task source price now prioritizes `dxm-single-submit-default-source-price` from localStorage.
- Category plans expanded for:
  - cable management clips -> `桌面理线器(Cable Organizers)`
  - cabinet bumpers -> `柜门消音垫(Cabinet Bumpers)`
  - toothbrush holder -> `牙膏架/牙刷架(Toothbrush & Toothpaste Holders)`
  - shower caddy -> `沐浴篮(Bath Baskets)`
  - kitchen utensil / paper towel holder family -> `收纳架(Racks & Holders)`
- Already-selected verified category is accepted before `aliexpress-evidence-required` blocking.
- Custom attribute deletion loop increased from 3 to 8 attempts.

New / updated Skills:
- Added `skills/dxm-three-step-product-edit/SKILL.md`.
- Updated `skills/dxm-batch-save-recovery/SKILL.md`.

Next required step:
- Activate Tampermonkey script `DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.94`, then continue the same 17-draft recovery from current draft box.
- Do not start a new 30-product validation.

- `B0FVXMVDMG` measuring spoons set: `category_evidence_required`
- `B0G1BKHG2J` bag clips: `category_evidence_required`

Root cause classification:
- Primary blocker: unknown product families hit the category-evidence-first gate, so Dianxiaomi category stayed blank and downstream price/freight/attribute checks cascaded.
- Do not count blank-category cascades as independent field failures.
- Next execution must run a dedicated AliExpress category-evidence pass before reopening these 17 drafts.

Execution-control issues:
- WebBridge `find_tab` matched older edit tabs when many similar `/edit?id=` tabs existed.
- Large batch `evaluate` scripts returned `webbridge_error`; short per-product commands worked.
- Native save sends no request when `销售方式 / 每包` is invalid at `0`; repair to a legal value before save.

New Skill:
- `skills/dxm-batch-save-recovery/SKILL.md`

Previous latest update:

Current phase: Recovery / wait-to-publish readback corrected

Important correction:
- The previous assistant-side summary incorrectly reported that the 5 remaining products did not enter wait-to-publish.
- Authoritative Dianxiaomi wait-to-publish readback now confirms all 6 correctly claimed Halo Home Store products are in wait-to-publish.
- Platform list readback is the source of truth; the agent's own WebBridge operation log was incomplete and must not override the platform state.

Readback source:
- URL: `https://www.dianxiaomi.com/web/smtlocalProduct/offline`
- Page: `速卖通海外托管 > 待发布产品`
- Store: `Halo Home Store`
- Count: `第1-6条，共 6 条记录`

Corrected batch result:
- Correct Halo Home Store draft products completed to wait-to-publish: `6 / 6`.
- Additional products completed after the earlier single successful item: `5 / 5`.
- The 4 Product Development / Draft wrong-target products remain untouched and out of scope.
- No final publish or one-click publish was executed.

Capability correction:
- Updated `skills/execution-efficiency-deposition/SKILL.md`:
  final browser execution summaries must verify the authoritative platform list page before scoring or reporting.
  If agent operation logs and platform readback differ, platform readback wins and project memory must be corrected.

Previous latest update:

Current phase: Recovery / capability deposition enforcement

Latest optimization:
- Added mandatory end-of-task efficiency deposition skill:
  - `skills/execution-efficiency-deposition/SKILL.md`
- This Skill now requires every meaningful task to output and record:
  - task summary;
  - successful steps;
  - failed steps;
  - reusable operations;
  - highest-time-cost step;
  - capability extraction;
  - Skill write/update;
  - DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md update;
  - current-status.md update;
  - efficiency optimization notes.

Efficiency bottleneck from the latest 5-product recovery attempt:
- Highest-time-cost step: `dxm_category_modal_search_high_cost` plus `field_dropdown_recovery_high_cost`.
- Main reason:
  - repeated Dianxiaomi category modal searches for unverified product families;
  - repeated Ant dropdown recovery after stale overlays or cross-field options;
  - repeated live WebBridge DOM reads where a cached category/field rule should have existed.

Reusable optimization rules now recorded:
- Cache category modal search results by product family and search term during a batch.
- Use verified Skill / Rule lookup before live WebBridge exploration.
- Use direct edit URL in a new tab when the current edit page has unsaved changes.
- Batch read-only DOM extraction into one evaluate call per product.
- Treat stale dropdown cross-field options as `select_overlay_cross_field_stale` and continue instead of repeatedly clicking.
- Separate `dxm_candidate_category_split` from `aliexpress_category_evidence_split`; only AliExpress evidence split is a category skip reason.

No Dianxiaomi business action was executed during this deposition update:
- no collection
- no claim
- no edit-page save
- no wait-to-publish move
- no one-click publish
- no final publish

Previous latest update:

Current phase: Recovery / execution-rule stabilization

Latest optimization:
- Established `AGENT.md` as the project business execution truth source.
- Added `TASK.md` for the current 10-category recovery batch and forbidden actions.
- Added executable Skills:
  - `skills/price-processing/SKILL.md`
  - `skills/field-fill-rule/SKILL.md`
  - `skills/failure-recovery/SKILL.md`
- Updated existing Skills:
  - `skills/dxm-edit-page-automation/SKILL.md`
  - `skills/batch-continuation-control/SKILL.md`
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to point execution back to `AGENT.md` first.

Corrected current category rules:
- Direct category reuse is allowed only for product-family categories that have succeeded to wait-to-publish or listing success.
- Every product family without success verification must first verify category on AliExpress, even if candidate rules, historical search results, Dianxiaomi candidates, or AI judgments exist.
- Dianxiaomi candidate split is `dxm_candidate_category_split`; it is an intermediate state and must return to AliExpress/Amazon evidence, not skip.
- Only AliExpress evidence itself splitting after verification is `aliexpress_category_evidence_split`, and only then can the product be skipped.
- Do not use the generic `category_evidence_split` as a skip reason.

Corrected current field rules:
- Product attributes are filled only when the field has a visible red `*`.
- Non-required `Material`, `is_customized`, `Certification`, `Color`, `Number of Pcs`, `Size`, and `销售方式/打包出售` are not filled and are not blockers.
- Required `Function` / `Feature` use exact obvious options when available; otherwise choose `Other/其他`.
- Required `Function` / `Feature` must choose a real dropdown option; ordinary input fields may be typed, but dropdown search text is not a selected value.
- Required `Material` / `Frame Material` must be filled from Amazon material evidence: exact dropdown match first, similar material second, any available material option third, then direct Amazon-material text input when the field has no dropdown options but accepts input.
- Required Ant dropdown flow is now: close stale dropdowns -> open target dropdown -> read visible options -> click a real option object -> read back selected label/item.
- Custom attributes are cleared/deleted by default, not rewritten.
- Marketing image `一键生成` is a required edit step.
- Variation Ships From is fixed to `美国(United States)`.
- Stock default is `15`; old `10` values are historical records only.
- Freight template must be selected as `111` through the real dropdown.

No Dianxiaomi business action was executed during this optimization:
- no collection
- no claim
- no edit-page save
- no wait-to-publish move
- no one-click publish
- no final publish

Previous latest update:

Current phase: Recovery / 10 different-category batch edit continuation

Latest execution result:
- Continued only from the 5 remaining Halo Home Store draft edit pages.
- No recollection, reclaim, Product Development draft cleanup, one-click publish, final publish, or unsafe release action was executed.
- Completed to wait-to-publish in this continuation: 0.
- Batch total completed to wait-to-publish remains 1 / 6:
  - `B0CNTG2PD9` / wall coat hooks.

Field-level skips in this continuation:
- Correction note after user review:
  - The old skip labels below are historical execution records, not current field rules.
  - `is_customized` is not a blocker when it has no red `*`.
  - Non-red-star `Material` is not a blocker.
  - Current execution must use the corrected rules at the top of this status file, `AGENT.md`, and `skills/field-fill-rule/SKILL.md`.
- `B0GDRKKWRC` / cabinet door bumpers
  - Category was selected as:
    `家装（硬装）(Home Improvement) > 五金(Hardware) > 家具五金(Furniture Hardware) > 柜门消音垫(Cabinet Bumpers)`.
  - Price, stock, SKU, dimensions, High-concerned chemical, Origin, Ships From, and Material were partially corrected.
  - Skipped because preflight remained unfixable without manual intervention:
    `is_customized_no_visible_options`, `variation_required_option_not_found`, `postage_111_not_selected`, `select_overlay_cross_field_stale`.
- `B07QQKJC1X` / toothbrush holder bathroom
  - Dianxiaomi visible category found and selected:
    `家居用品(Home & Garden) > 家居日用品(Household Merchandises) > 浴室用品(Bathroom Products) > 牙膏架/牙刷架(Toothbrush & Toothpaste Holders)`.
  - Price was set from Amazon original price: `5.69 x 7 x 1.55 = 61.74`.
  - High-concerned chemical and Origin were selected.
  - Skipped because Brand and Material dropdowns returned no safe selectable option:
    `brand_dropdown_no_none_option`, `material_option_not_found`.
- `B0FK51H5TL` / shower caddy bathroom
  - Dianxiaomi search results split between:
    `Bathroom Storage & Organization / Storage Shelves & Racks`
    and `Bathroom Hardware / Bathroom Shelves`.
  - Skipped as `category_evidence_split`; no save attempted.
- `B09ZYBQX8B` / kitchen utensil holder
  - Dianxiaomi visible category selected:
    `家居用品(Home & Garden) > 家用储存收藏用具(Home Storage & Organization) > 厨房收纳用品(Kitchen Storage & Organization) > 收纳架(Racks & Holders)`.
  - Price was set from Amazon original price: `12.95 x 7 x 1.55 = 140.51`.
  - Function, High-concerned chemical, Origin, Feature, and Material were selected.
  - Skipped because Brand dropdown did not expose `NONE/None` even after sync and dropdown state crossed into Material options:
    `brand_dropdown_no_none_option`, `select_overlay_cross_field_stale`.
- `B0BCQ3Y81H` / paper towel holder countertop
  - Dianxiaomi category search split between bathroom `纸巾架(Paper Holders)`, kitchen `纸巾盒(Tissue Boxes)`, and non-matching toilet paper holder paths.
  - Skipped as `category_evidence_split`; no save attempted.

Environment / WebBridge observations:
- A direct navigation away from unsaved `B0GDRKKWRC` hung on the current edit tab; recovery by opening the next edit URL in a new tab worked.
- A timed-out edit-page rule run temporarily replaced page scroll functions; scroll was restored using native functions from a temporary iframe.
- Category modal and Ant select dropdown overlays can remain stale and cross fields after timed-out runs; this is now recorded in `skills/dxm-edit-page-automation/SKILL.md`.
- No final WebBridge tab-control interruption remains active; browser operations were stopped after all 5 remaining drafts were classified.

Skill / memory update:
- Updated `skills/dxm-edit-page-automation/SKILL.md` with Recovery edit-page control rules:
  new-tab continuation for unsaved pages, scroll restoration, stale modal hiding, dropdown cross-field skip conditions, and field-level preflight skip reasons.

Previous latest update:

Current phase: Development / category evidence execution and capability deposition flow optimized

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.93

Why this update exists:
- User clarified that rule deposition is not a pre-execution human gate.
- For a new product family, the workflow must actively check AliExpress similar-product/category evidence, then search/select the corresponding visible Dianxiaomi category.
- Rule deposition happens after a product is saved to wait-to-publish and readback confirms the category.
- Product-level failures should be recorded and the batch should continue; they must not wait for manual intervention.

v1.1.93 / rule changes:
- Upgraded `bumpers-200291142` into an active visible-category rule for `Cabinet Bumpers`.
- Added visible Dianxiaomi category path:
  `家装（硬装）(Home Improvement) / 五金(Hardware) / 家具五金(Furniture Hardware) / 柜门消音垫(Cabinet Bumpers)`.
- Synced the updated active category rules into `src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js`.
- Added executable Skills:
  - `skills/category-evidence-execution/SKILL.md`
  - `skills/batch-continuation-control/SKILL.md`
  - `skills/capability-deposition/SKILL.md`
- Updated existing edit-page Skill:
  - `skills/dxm-edit-page-automation/SKILL.md`
- Updated rules:
  - `docs/category-resolution-system.md`
  - `docs/project-execution-rules.md`

Corrected execution policy:
- Missing learned rule => automatically run AliExpress / similar-product evidence lookup, not manual wait.
- Dianxiaomi candidate category split => record `dxm_candidate_category_split`, return to AliExpress/Amazon evidence, do not skip.
- AliExpress category evidence split => record `aliexpress_category_evidence_split`, skip current product, continue next.
- Dianxiaomi visible category not found after clear AliExpress evidence or a success-verified learned rule => record `dxm_visible_category_not_found`, skip current product, continue next.
- Preflight field cannot be auto-filled => record field-level failure, skip current product, continue next.
- Logo / brand image risk belongs to Amazon collection prefilter, not edit-stage manual wait.
- Every meaningful task must run capability deposition: summarize, extract reusable capability, write/update Skill, update project memory.

No Dianxiaomi business action was executed during this optimization:
- no collection
- no claim
- no edit-page save
- no wait-to-publish move
- no one-click publish
- no final publish

Previous latest update:

Current phase: Recovery / 10 different-category batch continuation from Halo Home Store drafts

Latest execution result:
- The recovery tab was opened directly at `https://www.dianxiaomi.com/web/smtlocalProduct/draft`.
- The page correctly showed `速卖通海外托管 > 采集箱`, store `Halo Home Store`, and `采集箱(6)`.
- Script versions on page were confirmed:
  - DXM Automation V1 V1.1.92
  - DXM Amazon Crawlbox V1 v0.1.29
  - save Payload V3 0.6.3
- The 6 target draft row ids were recovered from the draft list; no recollection or reclaim was executed.
- Batch Amazon original prices were recovered from `dxm_amazon_crawlbox_public_batch_v1`.

Completed to wait-to-publish:
- `B0CNTG2PD9` / wall coat hooks
  - Edit id: `167487782008416285`
  - Amazon original price: `15.99`
  - Formula: `15.99 x 7 x 1.55 = 173.49`
  - Category: `衣帽挂钩(Coat Hooks)`
  - Required attributes filled: Brand `NONE`, High-concerned chemical `天然未处理(None)`, Origin `美国(Origin)(US(Origin))`, Material `ABS(ABS)`, No. of Hooks `4个(4)`
  - Freight template: `111`
  - Ships From: `United States`
  - PC description was extended to pass the 500-character visible preflight.
  - `打包出售` was unchecked after Dianxiaomi visible save validation reported `请输入2~100000之间的数值`.
  - Success modal `产品已移入待发布` appeared and was closed with `X`; `创建新产品继续编辑` was not clicked.
  - Wait-to-publish readback confirmed SKU `B0CNTG2PD9`, category `衣帽挂钩(Coat Hooks)`, price `CNY 173.49`, stock `10`.

Still in draft / not saved:
- `B0GDRKKWRC` / cabinet door bumpers
  - Edit id: `167487782008416291`
  - Amazon original price: `9.90`
  - Automatic category step blocked as `aliexpress-evidence-required` because the old `bumpers-200291142` learned rule has categoryId evidence but no v1.1.92 visible category modal plan.
  - Manual visible category selection found `家装（硬装） > 五金 > 家具五金 > 柜门消音垫(Cabinet Bumpers)`, but the v1.1.92 rule gate still did not treat it as active evidence.
  - Preflight remained blocked: postage not `111`, required attributes incomplete (`brand`, `high_concerned_chemical`, `origin`, `material`), Ships From not accepted, price mismatch expected `107.42` but visible `60.44`, required variation attribute missing, and custom attributes invalid.
  - No save was executed after this failed preflight.
- `B07QQKJC1X` / toothbrush holder bathroom
- `B0FK51H5TL` / shower caddy bathroom
- `B09ZYBQX8B` / kitchen utensil holder
- `B0BCQ3Y81H` / paper towel holder countertop
  - These four remain in `速卖通海外托管 / Halo Home Store` draft.
  - Current `skills/category-resolver/learned_rules.json` has no active visible evidence rule for these product families.
  - Per v1.1.92 category-evidence-first rule, they must not be saved until AliExpress / DXM-visible category evidence is learned; expected blocker is `aliexpress-evidence-required`.

Current list state after recovery:
- Draft / collection box: `采集箱(5)`.
- Wait-to-publish contains `B0CNTG2PD9`.
- `发布中 (0)` and `发布失败 (0)` remained visible.

Safety confirmation:
- No final publish, one-click publish, release, online action, recollection, or reclaim was executed.
- The 4 Product Development / Draft mis-claims remain untouched.
- No WebBridge / tab-control interruption occurred in this recovery run; the direct edit URL path was stable.

Previous latest update:

Current phase: Development / claim modal fixed-channel guard prepared

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Amazon Crawlbox V1 v0.1.29

Why this update exists:
- User clarified that the Dianxiaomi claim-store modal is not a dynamic business choice.
- The platform channel must always be `速卖通海外托管`; selecting `产品开发 / 草稿箱` is always wrong for this project flow.

v0.1.29 changes:
- The claim modal now treats `速卖通海外托管` as the only allowed claim channel.
- The script no longer trusts the modal's default selected checkbox.
- Store candidates are read only from checkboxes after the `速卖通海外托管` header and before the next channel header.
- Checked targets under `产品开发`, `草稿箱`, or any non-`速卖通海外托管` channel are unselected before target selection.
- If the final checked target is still not under `速卖通海外托管`, the pipeline blocks before `确定` with `store_selection_wrong_target`.
- The panel label changed from `店铺名可空` to `托管店铺名`; matching remains scoped only to `速卖通海外托管`.

No Dianxiaomi business action was executed during this source/rule update:
- no collection
- no claim
- no edit
- no save
- no one-click-publish
- no final publish

Previous latest update:

Current phase: Recovery / 10 different-category execution interrupted by WebBridge tab-control timeout

User instruction:
- Execute 10 different-category products to wait-to-publish.
- Do not publish or one-click publish.

Execution checkpoint:
- 10 Amazon candidates were prepared with Amazon original USD prices.
- First collection attempt produced 4 unclaimed rows:
  - B0D141F3F5 travel soap dish
  - B0BZCVQ77H cable organizer clips
  - B0CY9FWV19 rotating pen holder
  - B0D2WCNK3K sink strainer
- These 4 were accidentally claimed to Product Development / Draft because the claim-store modal initially selected `草稿箱`; mark them failed for this 10-category batch as `store_selection_wrong_target`. Do not edit them in this batch.
- Remaining 6 were collected and then correctly claimed to `速卖通海外托管 / Halo Home Store`:
  - B0CNTG2PD9 wall coat hooks
  - B0GDRKKWRC cabinet door bumpers
  - B07QQKJC1X toothbrush holder bathroom
  - B0FK51H5TL shower caddy bathroom
  - B09ZYBQX8B kitchen utensil holder
  - B0BCQ3Y81H paper towel holder countertop
- Correct Halo Home Store claim result was confirmed by modal text:
  `速卖通海外托管采集认领执行完成，成功 6 条，失败 0 条`.
- The 6 rows were visible in `https://www.dianxiaomi.com/web/smtlocalProduct/draft` under `「速卖通海外托管」采集箱(6)`.

Interruption:
- Editing did not start.
- WebBridge could not reliably focus the correct draft tab after old sample edit tabs entered the same session.
- Direct DOM click and CDP click on row `编辑` did not open the edit page from the draft list.
- Computer Use focused an older Chrome tab (`/web/smtlocalProduct/offline`) instead of the active WebBridge batch tab.
- Attempts to close/focus tabs through WebBridge timed out and were interrupted to avoid unsafe repeated actions.

Safety confirmation:
- No final publish, one-click publish, release, or online action was executed.
- No edit-page save to wait-to-publish was completed in this interrupted run.

Recovery target:
- Do not recollect the 6 correctly claimed Halo Home Store draft products.
- Recover by focusing the tab with `agent:dxm-10cat-exec` / `https://www.dianxiaomi.com/web/smtlocalProduct/draft` that shows `采集箱(6)`.
- Continue from edit stage for the 6 Halo Home Store drafts.
- The 4 Product Development mis-claims remain failed for this batch unless user explicitly authorizes cleanup/reclaim.

Previous latest update:

Current phase: Development / store-license dedup knowledge base documented

Rule update:
- Added the business-license-group deduplication knowledge base.
- Dedup scope is now explicitly `businessLicenseGroup + productKey`, not global ASIN.
- Same business-license group: the same product must not be collected or claimed again across the 6 stores under that license.
- Different business-license groups: the same product can be reused when business value justifies it, especially good-selling or high-potential products.
- New collection/listing tasks must declare `businessLicenseGroup` and `targetStore`; unknown license group blocks collection/claim as `license_group_unknown`.

Implementation status:
- Rule and documentation are in place.
- Code-level license-group registry and dedup ledger are still pending.
- Until that ledger exists, duplicate-scope decisions must be recorded manually in the task/report.

Reference:
- docs/store-license-dedup-rules.md

Previous source status:
Current phase: Development / v1.1.92 AliExpress category-evidence-first flow prepared

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.92

Why this update exists:
- User corrected the direction: the high-accuracy action is AliExpress image-search / similar-product category evidence, not continuing the old DeepSeek/local-keyword-first category flow.
- The old flow must be replaced where a better, higher-accuracy flow exists.

v1.1.92 changes:
- Active visible category rules from `skills/category-resolver/learned_rules.json` now sync into the userscript even when they have no numeric `categoryId`.
- Edit-page category modal plans are generated from verified AliExpress / similar-product / DXM-visible category evidence first.
- If no evidence rule exists, edit-page category selection blocks as `aliexpress-evidence-required`.
- Legacy hardcoded keyword category plans are retained only as disabled diagnostic/reference code and are not allowed to auto-save.
- Current verified visible category evidence now includes:
  - `Pen Holders`
  - `Cable Organizers`
  - `Portable Soap Dishes`
  - `Coat Hooks`
  - `Kitchen Drains & Strainers`
- DeepSeek remains product-understanding only; it is not the final category judge.

Next validation target:
- User covers Tampermonkey with v1.1.92.
- AliExpress / 速卖通 has been pinned in the user's Chrome toolbar/session and should be reused as the stable logged-in category-evidence entry.
- Run the next 10 different-category test with this order:
  1. Amazon product
  2. AliExpress image-search / similar-product category evidence
  3. category candidate scoring / evidence rule
  4. Dianxiaomi visible category selection
  5. edit-page rule fill
  6. save to wait-to-publish only
- If a product has no AliExpress category evidence, skip/save-block it and record `aliexpress-evidence-required`.

No Dianxiaomi business action was executed during v1.1.92 source preparation:
- no collection
- no claim
- no edit-page save
- no one-click-publish
- no final publish
- no release/online action
```

Current phase: Execution / remaining draft continuation with v1.1.91

User instruction:
- Do not correct the remaining abnormal wait-to-publish prices right now.
- Finish the remaining collection-box products to wait-to-publish where possible.
- Do not recollect, publish, one-click-publish, release, or upgrade version.
- After a successful edit save, close the `产品已移入待发布` popup with the `X`; do not click `创建新产品继续编辑`.

Active live version:
- DXM Automation V1 V1.1.91

Execution result:
- Wait-to-publish now has 5 records.
- Draft / collection box now has 0 records.
- Successfully moved in this continuation: 2 products.
- Skipped in this continuation: 0 products.
- No final publish, one-click-publish, release, online, or new collection action was executed.

Success:
- `B0CNSYPZBQ`
  - Product: cable holder / adhesive cable clip.
  - Amazon source price used: `$4.99`.
  - Formula: `4.99 × 7 × 1.55 = 54.14`.
  - Initial v1.1.91 category plan failed at `线缆工具(Cable Tools)`.
  - No-code edit-page recovery selected the verified visible leaf `桌面理线器(Cable Organizers)`.
  - Final wait-to-publish readback: category `桌面理线器(Cable Organizers)`, `CNY 54.14`, stock `10`.
  - Success popup was closed with `X`; `创建新产品继续编辑` was not clicked.
- `B0C9ZHWC9K`

  - Category: `笔筒(Pen Holders)`.
  - Required attributes: Brand `NONE`, high-concerned chemical `天然未处理(None)`, Origin `美国(Origin)(US(Origin))`, Material `塑料(Plastic)`.
  - Freight template: `111`.
  - Wait-to-publish readback: `CNY 108.28`, stock `100`, category `笔筒(Pen Holders)`.

Remaining risk:
- Existing wait-to-publish rows `B09PFW8WRQ` (`CNY 2060.85`) and `B0BPS66NC3` (`CNY 77927.63`) still contain old abnormal prices from before the v1.1.91 strict price-source fix.
- Per user instruction, these were not corrected in this continuation.
- They must not be published until strict Amazon-source price correction is performed.

Current phase: Validation / v1.1.91 strict price-source fix live-validated

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.91
- This follows the price-readback issue after `B0D65JFRX4` was saved with wrong supply price `CNY 1913.61`.

v1.1.91 changes:
- The only accepted supply-price rule is now: `Amazon 原价 USD × task exchange rate × task multiplier`.
- `Amazon 原价 USD` must come from the current task input/context; missing source price blocks preflight/save.
- Removed price fallback to Dianxiaomi edit-page price, UI numeric scans, cached batch price, `product.price`, `sourcePrice`, `minPrice`, `maxPrice`, and manual CNY supply-price override.
- Edit-page visible preflight now verifies the visible variation goods value equals the formula result.
- Payload preflight now blocks missing trusted Amazon original price or SKU price mismatch.
- Category, Material, Color, freight template, custom attributes, title, save, move-to-wait-publish, one-click-publish, and publish controls are otherwise unchanged.

Validation status:
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node.
- Strict price-source checks passed.
- `git diff --check` passed for the source.
- Tampermonkey overwrite completed by user.
- Live page confirmed `DXM Automation V1 V1.1.91`.
- Empty-source validation passed: with no `Amazon 原价 USD`, preflight blocked price as `缺少Amazon 原价 USD` and did not reuse visible wrong price `1913.61`.
- Amazon read-only source check found current buy-box price `$9.99` and list price `$11.99`; current buy-box price `$9.99` was used for the task formula.
- Formula validation passed: `9.99 × 7 × 1.55 = 108.39`; visible goods value became `108.39`, price preflight `ok=true`, and `risks=[]`.
- `B0D65JFRX4` was saved after fixing a separate visible Dianxiaomi save blocker (`打包出售` checked with `每包=0`; unchecked for single-piece sale).
- Wait-to-publish readback now confirms `B0D65JFRX4` price `CNY 108.39`.
- No final publish, one-click-publish, release, online action, or new collection action was executed.
- Remaining observed risk: other wait-to-publish rows still show abnormal old prices (`B09PFW8WRQ` `CNY 2060.85`, `B0BPS66NC3` `CNY 77927.63`) and must be corrected with strict Amazon source price before any publish.

Latest save result:
- User authorized the next step after v1.1.90 preflight passed.
- One native `保存并移入待发布` action was completed for `B0D65JFRX4` / `167487782006920301`.
- Dianxiaomi showed success modal: `产品已移入待发布，请在「待发布」中查看！`
- Wait-to-publish readback confirmed:
  - Title: `Sink Drain Strainer Sink Stopper Kitchen Drain, 3 in 1 Kitchen Sink Drain`
  - Store: `Halo Home Store`

  - Stock: `15`
- Wait-to-publish list now shows 3 records: `B0D65JFRX4`, `B09PFW8WRQ`, and `B0BPS66NC3`.
- Draft/collection box now shows 2 remaining products.
- No final publish, one-click-publish, release, or online request was observed.

v1.1.90 live validation result:
- Live page confirmed `DXM Automation V1 V1.1.90`.
- One `应用编辑页规则` click was executed on `B0D65JFRX4` / `167487782006920301`.
- Three-step rule completed:
  1. Confirmed issue: Material existed as `.smtDynamicAttr10` but was hidden behind `+展开`.
  2. Optimized narrowly: expand product attributes before Material selection and prioritize stainless/metal material values.
  3. Verified target: edit-page preflight now passes.
- Final key fields:
  - Category: `厨房水槽水漏、过滤网(Kitchen Drains & Strainers)`
  - Brand: `NONE(AE存量)*******(None)`
  - High-concerned chemical: `天然未处理(None)`
  - Origin: `美国(Origin)(US(Origin))`

  - Custom attributes: `0`
- `preflight.pass=true`, `risks=[]`.
- Network capture showed 0 matching save/publish requests.
- No save, move-to-wait-publish, one-click-publish, publish, or new collection action was executed.
- Save gate completed after explicit user authorization.

v1.1.89 live validation result:
- Live page confirmed `DXM Automation V1 V1.1.89`.
- One `应用编辑页规则` click was executed.
- Category succeeded: `厨房水槽水漏、过滤网(Kitchen Drains & Strainers)`.
- Selected full path: `家装（硬装）(Home Improvement)/厨房设施(Kitchen Fixture)/厨房水槽配件(Kitchen Sink Accessories)/厨房水槽水漏、过滤网(Kitchen Drains & Strainers)`.
- Old wrong category `商用餐厨操作类电器（带电）` did not appear.
- Freight template `111`, Brand, High-concerned chemical, Origin, Ships From, Color, custom attributes, and title sanitation were handled.
- Preflight remained blocked only by `required attributes incomplete: material`.
- Network capture showed 0 matching save/publish requests; no save, move-to-wait-publish, one-click-publish, or publish action was executed.

v1.1.90 changes:
- Expands the product-attribute section when `smtDynamicAttr10` Material exists but is hidden behind `+展开`.
- Kitchen sink strainer material candidates now prioritize `不锈钢(Stainless Steel)` / metal values.
- Category, freight, title, custom attributes, save, move-to-wait-publish, one-click-publish, and publish logic are unchanged.

Validation status:
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node.
- `git diff --check` passed for the source.
- Tampermonkey overwrite completed by user.
- Live validation passed on `B0D65JFRX4`.
- `B0D65JFRX4` is now in wait-to-publish.
- No final publish action has been executed.
- Next gate remains: do not publish without explicit authorization.

Current phase: Development / v1.1.89 AliExpress resolver category-selection integration prepared

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.89
- This is the first narrow execution-layer connection from AliExpress Category Resolver evidence into Dianxiaomi edit-page category selection.

v1.1.89 changes:
- Promoted validated AliExpress `postCategoryId=200231151` for kitchen sink drain strainers into active category rules.
- Added Dianxiaomi visible path evidence: `家装（硬装）(Home Improvement)/厨房设施(Kitchen Fixture)/厨房水槽配件(Kitchen Sink Accessories)/厨房水槽水漏、过滤网(Kitchen Drains & Strainers)`.
- Narrowed the edit-page kitchen sink strainer category modal plan to search `水槽`, `Sink`, `Drain`, `Strainer`, and `滤网` before broad kitchen terms.
- Added exact accepted leaf terms `厨房水槽水漏、过滤网` and `Kitchen Drains & Strainers`.
- Continued rejecting wrong sink-strainer paths such as faucet, bathroom drain, soap dish, commercial kitchen appliance, and electric appliance categories.
- Save, move-to-wait-publish, one-click-publish, publish, freight, Material, Color, title, and custom-attribute logic are unchanged.

Validation status:
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node.
- JSON validation passed for category resolver rules and AliExpress category ID map.
- `git diff --check` passed for touched source/rule/tool files.
- Tampermonkey overwrite pending.
- Live validation pending on `B0D65JFRX4`; expected first target is correct category selection only, then preflight decides whether save can be allowed.
- `B0C9ZHWC9K` remains a Material/readback blocker, not a category blocker.
- `B0CNSYPZBQ` remains blocked from auto-save because AliExpress category evidence is split and needs stronger mapping/similarity ranking.

Current phase: Development / v1.1.88 category family scoring prepared

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.88
- This follows the requested direction: do not hard-fix the remaining 3 products one by one; build reusable category candidate scoring + blacklist/whitelist + product-family rules, then use the remaining products as validation samples.

v1.1.88 changes:
- Added category-family scoring rules for desk pen holders, adhesive cable clips, kitchen sink strainers, and adhesive wall hooks.
- Dianxiaomi category search API candidates now receive family allow/reject scoring.
- Edit-page category modal search results now use the same product-family scoring when choosing among returned candidates.
- Cable-clip family rejects conductive glue paste / glue-paste paths such as `导电线胶膏`.
- Sink-strainer family rejects commercial kitchen appliance / electric appliance paths such as `商用餐厨操作类电器`.
- Pen-holder family keeps `Rotating Pen Organizer` under the desk stationery / pen holder family and rejects unrelated cable/hook/kitchen/bathroom paths.
- Diagnostic output now includes `familyScore` for category candidates and selected category.
- Category, Material, freight template, Color, custom attributes, save, and publish controls are otherwise unchanged.

Validation status:
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node.
- `git diff --check` passed for the source and status files.
- Lightweight rule checks passed:
  - adhesive cable clips rejects `导电线胶膏(Conductive Wire Glue Pastes)`;
  - kitchen sink strainer rejects `商用餐厨操作类电器(Commercial Kitchen Operation Appliances)`;
  - rotating pen organizer accepts `笔筒(Pen Holders)`.
- Tampermonkey overwrite pending.
- Live validation pending on the remaining failed products as samples, especially `B0CNSYPZBQ`, `B0D65JFRX4`, and `B0C9ZHWC9K`.

Current phase: Development / v1.1.87 Rotating title-risk false positive fix prepared

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.87
- Based on user correction for `B0C9ZHWC9K`: `Rotating` is a real product function for the rotating pen/desk organizer and should not be marked as a title risk.

v1.1.87 changes:
- `Rotating` is now treated as a generic/functional leading word, not a suspected brand candidate.
- This prevents titles such as `Rotating Pen Organizer...` from being blocked as brand/trademark/platform risk solely because `Rotating` is the first word.
- Title rules now document that true function words backed by Amazon/title/detail/product-structure evidence are allowed.
- Category, Material, freight template, Color, custom attributes, save, and publish controls are unchanged.

Validation status:
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node.
- `git diff --check` passed for the source and status files.
- Lightweight rule check passed: `Rotating Pen` no longer matches the first-token brand-candidate pattern.
- Tampermonkey overwrite pending.
- Live validation pending.

Current phase: Development / v1.1.86 Color single-vs-multi rule prepared

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.86
- Based on user correction after v1.1.85: Color should not default to `MULTI` when the product is single-color.
- The previous v1.1.85 single-sample fill + preflight + save result remains the current validated save anchor.

v1.1.86 changes:
- Color selection now checks source evidence from the edit title, edit data, and Amazon public batch item before selecting a Color option.
- If only one Color option is visible, it selects that option.
- If source evidence clearly indicates a single supported color, it selects the matching real color option.
- `MULTI/多色` is used only when source evidence indicates multi-color, or when color evidence is unknown and MULTI is available as a conservative fallback.
- Category, Brand, High-concerned chemical, Origin, Material, freight template, custom attributes, save, and publish control are unchanged.

Validation status:
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node.
- `git diff --check` passed for the source and status files.
- Tampermonkey overwrite pending.
- Live validation pending.

Current phase: Validation / v1.1.85 single-sample edit-page save passed

Latest live save validation:
- User explicitly authorized clicking Save.
- DXM Automation V1 V1.1.85 preflight was confirmed before save: `preflight.pass=true`, `risks=[]`.
- One native Dianxiaomi `保存` button click was executed.
- Page showed success message: `您的产品编辑成功！`.
- Page navigated to `https://www.dianxiaomi.com/web/smtlocalProduct/offline`.
- Wait-to-publish list shows the product row:
  - Title: `Silicone Soap Dish with Drain Spout, Self Draining Sink Organizer Tray`
  - Store: `Halo Home Store`
  - Ships From: `美国`
  - Category: `便携肥皂盒（非安装，非金属）(Portable Soap Dishes)`
  - SKU: `B0BPS66NC3`
  - Stock: `15`
- No publish or one-click publish action was executed.
- Network capture did not show publish / one-click publish / release requests.

Current classification:
- Single-sample edit-page fill + preflight + save validation passed.
- Product is now in wait-to-publish/offline list.
- Final publish remains prohibited unless explicitly authorized.

Current phase: Validation / v1.1.85 single-sample edit-page preflight passed

Latest live validation:
- DXM Automation V1 V1.1.85 was live-confirmed on sample `167487782006885971`.
- One `应用编辑页规则` click was executed.
- No save, one-click publish, publish, or `save.json`/publish network request was captured.
- Final `window.__DXM_AUTOMATION_V1_LAST_RESULT__.preflight.pass=true`.
- Final preflight risks: `[]`.
- Target fields passed: category `便携肥皂盒（非安装，非金属）(Portable Soap Dishes)`, Brand `NONE`, High-concerned chemical `天然未处理(None)`, Origin `美国(Origin)(US(Origin))`, Material `硅胶(Silicone)`, freight template `111`, Color `MULTI`, Ships From `美国(United States)`, custom attributes cleared with no 70-character error.
- Page readback confirmed Material combobox input value `硅胶(Silicone)`.

Current classification:
- v1.1.85 single-sample edit-page repair validation passed.
- Edit-page fields are ready for the next authorized step.
- Still not saved and not published. Saving requires explicit user authorization.

Current phase: Validation / v1.1.85 preflight readback fix prepared

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.85
- Live v1.1.84 confirmed Material selection behavior is fixed: execution result and DOM readback show `硅胶(Silicone)`, dropdown closed, and no `木头(Wood)` remains.
- Live v1.1.84 also confirmed category `Portable Soap Dishes`, Brand `NONE`, High-concerned chemical `天然未处理(None)`, Origin `美国(Origin)(US(Origin))`, freight template `111`, Color `MULTI`, custom attributes cleared, and 0 save/publish requests.
- Remaining blocker is preflight/readback mismatch only: Material and Ships From are visible in the page/DOM but final preflight reads them as empty.

v1.1.85 changes:
- `getSelectedTextInContainer()` now reads visible Ant combobox/search input values, not only selected item text and text inputs.
- Ships From preflight now accepts visible `美国/United States` section text when no checkbox checked state is exposed.
- Material dropdown selection behavior is unchanged from v1.1.84.
- Category, freight, custom attributes, title, High-concerned chemical, and Origin logic are unchanged.

Validation status:
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node.
- `git diff --check` passed for the source and status files.
- Tampermonkey overwrite pending.
- Live single-sample validation pending.

Current phase: Validation / v1.1.84 live material value verified, preflight readback mismatch

Latest live validation:
- DXM Automation V1 V1.1.84 was live-confirmed on sample `167487782006885971`.
- One `应用编辑页规则` click was executed.
- No save, one-click publish, publish, or `save.json`/publish network request was captured.
- Stable target fields: category `便携肥皂盒（非安装，非金属）(Portable Soap Dishes)`, Brand `NONE`, High-concerned chemical `天然未处理(None)`, Origin `美国(Origin)(US(Origin))`, freight template `111`, Color `MULTI`, and custom attributes cleared with no 70-character error.
- Material execution result: `ok=true`, `selectedText=硅胶(Silicone)`, `optionText=硅胶(Silicone)`, mode `fixed-option-click-keyboard-lock`.
- Material DOM readback: Ant search input value is `硅胶(Silicone)`, dropdown closed, no `木头(Wood)` remains.
- Remaining issue: final preflight still reports `required attributes incomplete: material` because the current readback path only checks `.ant-select-selection-item` selected text; this Material control stores/displays the committed value in the visible combobox search input.
- Existing unrelated preflight readback issue remains: `ships from is not United States: empty`, while execution and visible page readback show `美国(United States)`.

Current classification:
- Material wrong-value bug is fixed in v1.1.84.
- Do not continue changing Material selection behavior blindly.
- Next change, if needed, should be a narrow preflight/readback correction for Ant combobox input-value fields and Ships From visible readback, not another Material dropdown selection rewrite.

Current phase: Validation / v1.1.84 material prefilter commit fix prepared

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.84
- Live v1.1.83 validation on sample `167487782006885971` improved Material from wrong `木头(Wood)` to input value `硅胶(Silicone)`, and the execution result marked Material `ok=true`.
- Page readback still showed Material only as the Ant select search input value, not as a selected item; plugin preflight still reported `required attributes incomplete: material`.
- Previous good fields stayed stable: category `Portable Soap Dishes`, Brand `NONE`, High-concerned chemical `天然未处理(None)`, Origin `美国(Origin)(US(Origin))`, freight template `111`, Color `MULTI`, and custom attributes cleared.
- No save, one-click publish, publish, or `save.json`/publish network request was captured.

v1.1.84 changes:
- Material selection now filters the open dropdown to exact `硅胶(Silicone)` before option lookup and keyboard confirmation.
- This keeps keyboard confirmation available, but only after the list has been narrowed to the intended material, avoiding unfiltered default/highlight acceptance such as `木头(Wood)`.
- Category, freight, custom attributes, title, High-concerned chemical, and Origin logic are unchanged.

Validation status:
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node.
- `git diff --check` passed for the source and status files.
- Tampermonkey overwrite pending.
- Live single-sample validation pending.

Current phase: Validation / v1.1.83 material no-keyboard commit fix prepared

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.83
- Live v1.1.82 validation on sample `167487782006885971` confirmed the previous good fields stayed stable: category `Portable Soap Dishes`, Brand `NONE`, High-concerned chemical `天然未处理(None)`, Origin `美国(Origin)(US(Origin))`, freight template `111`, Color `MULTI`, and custom attributes cleared.
- No save, one-click publish, publish, or `save.json`/publish network request was captured.
- Remaining blocker: Material still did not commit. v1.1.82 found/clicked option `硅胶(Silicone)`, but the field ended with search input `木头(Wood)` and no selected item, so keyboard confirmation is selecting the wrong highlighted/default option.

v1.1.83 changes:
- Material candidates now prioritize exact `硅胶(Silicone)` before generic silicone/rubber terms.
- Material uses fixed option click without Enter/Tab keyboard commit, avoiding wrong default/highlight acceptance such as `木头(Wood)`.
- Category, freight, custom attributes, title, High-concerned chemical, and Origin logic are unchanged.

Validation status:
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node.
- `git diff --check` passed for the source and status files.
- Tampermonkey overwrite pending.
- Live single-sample validation pending.

Current phase: Validation / v1.1.82 material dropdown commit fix prepared

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.82
- Live v1.1.81 validation on sample `167487782006885971` confirmed the Origin blocker is fixed.
- v1.1.81 achieved: category `便携肥皂盒（非安装，非金属）(Portable Soap Dishes)`, Brand `NONE`, High-concerned chemical `天然未处理(None)`, Origin `美国(Origin)(US(Origin))`, freight template `111`, Color `MULTI`, and custom attributes cleared with no 70-character error.
- No save, one-click publish, publish, or `save.json`/publish network request was captured.
- Remaining blocker: Material did not commit as a real selected item. The run result reported `Silicone Rubber`, but page readback showed only the material search input value, and preflight still marked `material` missing.

v1.1.82 changes:
- Material now uses the same fixed dropdown option click/lock path as other locked required fields instead of the generic keyboard-entry selector.
- Material confirms with keyboard after option selection.
- Category, freight, custom attributes, title, High-concerned chemical, and Origin logic are unchanged.

Validation status:
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node.
- `git diff --check` passed for the source and status files.
- Tampermonkey overwrite pending.
- Live single-sample validation pending.

Current phase: Validation / v1.1.81 current-field dropdown opener fix prepared

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.81
- Live v1.1.80 did not improve the Origin blocker; Origin again stopped with `fixed option not found in active dropdown`.
- Previous read-only diagnosis already confirmed the Origin dropdown contains visible `美国(Origin)(US(Origin))`.
- Current classification: current-field dropdown opening/association is unstable, not missing option data.

v1.1.81 changes:
- Closes previous visible dropdowns before each fixed field.
- Clicks the current field once instead of using the old broad opener that can toggle the dropdown.
- Confirms a visible dropdown rendered before searching current visible options.
- Category, freight, custom attributes, title, and business values are unchanged.

Validation status:
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node.
- `git diff --check` passed for the source and status files.
- Tampermonkey overwrite pending.
- Live single-sample validation pending.

Current phase: Validation / v1.1.80 required-attribute dropdown sequencing fix prepared

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.80
- Live v1.1.79 selected High-concerned chemical as `天然未处理(None)`.
- v1.1.79 retained the previous good results: category `Portable Soap Dishes`, Brand `NONE`, custom attributes cleared, freight template `111`, and Color `MULTI`.
- No save, one-click publish, publish, or `save.json`/publish request was captured.
- Remaining blocker: Origin stopped with `fixed option not found in active dropdown`; Material did not run because the locked pipeline stopped at Origin.
- Read-only diagnosis confirmed the Origin dropdown contains visible `美国(Origin)(US(Origin))`, so this is dropdown sequencing/render timing, not missing business data.

v1.1.80 changes:
- Closes any previous visible select dropdown before opening the next required field.
- Waits longer for the current dropdown render.
- Retries exact visible-option lookup during the render window.
- Category, freight, custom attributes, and title logic are unchanged from v1.1.79.

Validation status:
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node.
- `git diff --check` passed for the source and status files.
- Tampermonkey overwrite pending.
- Live single-sample validation pending.

Current phase: Validation / v1.1.79 required-attribute dropdown lookup fix prepared

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.79
- Live v1.1.78 achieved the category target: `便携肥皂盒（非安装，非金属）(Portable Soap Dishes)`.
- v1.1.78 also cleared custom attributes, selected Brand `NONE`, selected freight template `111`, and selected Color `MULTI`.
- No save, one-click publish, publish, or `save.json`/publish request was captured.
- Remaining blocker: High-concerned chemical, Origin, and Material stayed `请选择`.
- Read-only diagnosis confirmed the High-concerned chemical dropdown really contains `天然未处理(None)`, so the issue is dropdown option lookup/commit, not missing business data.

v1.1.79 changes:
- Fixed dropdown lookup now falls back to all currently visible dropdown options if active-dropdown matching misses.
- If still not found, it types the target value into the open dropdown search and retries.
- Category, freight, custom attributes, and title logic are unchanged from v1.1.78.

Validation status:
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node.
- `git diff --check` passed for the source and status files.
- Tampermonkey overwrite pending.
- Live single-sample validation pending.

Current phase: Validation / v1.1.78 soap-dish category priority fix prepared

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.78
- Live v1.1.77 confirmed the search-result-row click path works.
- v1.1.77 still failed the target because it selected `皂盒(Soap Box)` instead of `便携肥皂盒 / Portable Soap Dishes`.
- No save, one-click publish, publish, or `save.json`/publish request was captured.

v1.1.78 changes:
- `Soap Box` is removed from accepted soap-dish leaf terms.
- `Soap Box` is added to reject terms for the soap-dish plan.
- Search-result matching now prioritizes earlier leaf terms before shorter result text, so `便携肥皂盒 / Portable Soap Dishes` outranks shorter nearby categories.

Validation status:
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node.
- `git diff --check` passed for the source and status files.
- Tampermonkey overwrite pending.
- Live single-sample validation pending.

Current phase: Validation / v1.1.77 category search-result leaf click prepared

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.77
- Live v1.1.76 confirmed wrong generic fallback is blocked and scroll stayed stable at 0.
- v1.1.76 did not reach the target category; it stopped at category with `genericFallbackDisabled=true`.
- Read-only modal diagnosis confirmed the correct target `便携肥皂盒（非安装，非金属）(Portable Soap Dishes)` appears after searching `浴室` as a full-path `.search-result-item`.
- Root cause: old leaf matcher filtered out full-path rows with multiple `/`, so it could not click the correct result row.

v1.1.77 changes:
- Adds direct search-result-row leaf matching before column/item fallback.
- Keeps reject terms for wrong bathroom categories such as `Bathroom Accessories Sets / 浴室配件套装`.
- No brand/material/freight/custom-attribute logic changed in this version.

Validation status:
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node.
- `git diff --check` passed for the source and status files.
- Tampermonkey overwrite pending.
- Live single-sample validation pending.

Current phase: Validation / v1.1.76 category wrong-fallback guard prepared

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.76
- Live v1.1.75 confirmed the specific soap-dish category plan still did not complete.
- Failure mode: after the planned modal selection failed, generic `category-button-modal` fallback selected `浴室配件套装 / Bathroom Accessories Sets`.
- This is now classified as a wrong-fallback write risk, not a new product-understanding issue.

v1.1.76 changes:
- When a specific category modal plan exists, planned failure now stops the category step.
- Generic category fallback is disabled for that planned product path.
- Result exposes `genericFallbackDisabled=true` so validation can distinguish a controlled stop from an accidental wrong-category write.

Validation status:
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node.
- `git diff --check` passed for the source and status files.
- Tampermonkey overwrite pending.
- Live single-sample validation pending.

Current phase: Validation / v1.1.75 category exact-leaf priority retry prepared

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.75
- Live v1.1.74 confirmed category search now triggers and returns bathroom category results.
- v1.1.74 still failed the target because it selected `浴室配件套装（不同配件套装，单一配件多个套装属错放类目）(Bathroom Accessories Sets)` instead of `便携肥皂盒 / Portable Soap Dishes`.
- Classification: category result exact-leaf priority failure, not search-submit failure and not product understanding failure.

v1.1.75 changes:
- Category modal leaf matching accepts plan-level reject terms.
- Nodes containing rejected bathroom categories such as `Bathroom Accessories Sets / 浴室配件套装` are filtered before click.

Validation status:
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node.
- `git diff --check` passed for the source file.
- v1.1.75 source has been prepared for Tampermonkey overwrite.

Current phase: Validation / v1.1.74 category search-submit retry prepared

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.74
- Live v1.1.73 still stopped at category; selected text remained `零配件(Accessories & Parts)`.
- A diagnostic category-modal open showed the top search input contained `浴室`, but the modal list remained on the original `Consumer Electronics > Accessories & Parts` tree.
- Classification: category modal search-submit event chain failure, not product understanding failure.

v1.1.74 changes:
- Category modal search input is written through native input setter without immediate blur.
- Search input dispatches `beforeinput`, `input`, `change`, and Enter key events.
- Search button receives React `onMouseDown` / `onClick` and normal click.

Validation status:
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node.
- `git diff --check` passed for the source file.
- v1.1.74 source has been prepared for Tampermonkey overwrite.

Current phase: Validation / v1.1.73 category confirmation retry prepared

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.73
- Live v1.1.72 confirmed the pipeline stopped cleanly at category and scroll stayed at 0, but category still remained `零配件(Accessories & Parts)`.
- v1.1.72 result still contained the correct target path text `便携肥皂盒 / Portable Soap Dishes`, so the remaining blocker is category-modal leaf click / confirm, not product understanding.

v1.1.73 changes:
- Category modal matching returns the deepest matching leaf node instead of a parent path container.
- After top search, modal plan tries direct leaf click before column matching.
- Category modal confirm can click a global bottom `选择 / 确定` button if it is outside the modal subtree.

Validation status:
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node.
- `git diff --check` passed for the source file.
- v1.1.73 source has been prepared for Tampermonkey overwrite.

Current phase: Validation / v1.1.72 category leaf-click retry prepared

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.72
- Live v1.1.71 was confirmed active and `应用编辑页规则` was clicked once on sample `167487782006885971`.
- v1.1.71 improved part of the pipeline: title became `Silicone Soap Dish with Drain Spout, Self Draining Sink Organizer Tray`, custom attributes were cleared, and freight template was selected as exact `111`.
- v1.1.71 still failed the target: category remained `零配件(Accessories & Parts)`, required attributes were incomplete, and ships-from was absent because the wrong category did not expose the expected variation-parameter block.
- Root cause found from `window.__DXM_AUTOMATION_V1_LAST_RESULT__`: category selection matched text containing the correct `便携肥皂盒 / Portable Soap Dishes` path, but clicked a broad modal container (`选择类目 搜索 ... 关闭`) instead of the leaf item; Brand fallback then targeted non-required `品牌制造商`.

v1.1.72 changes:
- Category modal matching now rejects dialog/search/close container text before clicking.
- Brand required-attribute matching excludes `品牌制造商`, `manufacturer`, `欧盟`, and `土耳其`.
- Sequential pipeline stops immediately if category is not confirmed, instead of continuing into category-dependent fields.

Validation status:
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node.
- `git diff --check` passed for the source file.
- v1.1.72 source has been prepared for Tampermonkey overwrite.

Current phase: Validation / v1.1.71 single-sample retry prepared

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.71
- Live v1.1.70 was confirmed active and the edit-rule button was clicked once on sample `167487782006885971`.
- v1.1.70 did not meet the target: category stayed `Consumer Electronics > Accessories & Parts`, title still contained `Micoyang`, fixed required attributes were incomplete, ships-from was not selected, marketing image status was not recognized, and the page later moved to scrollY 2337.5.
- v1.1.70 did partially pass: freight template showed exact `111`, custom attributes were handled, and network capture showed 0 save / 0 publish requests.
- Classification: edit-page execution-chain failure, not product business failure and not publish failure.

v1.1.71 changes:
- Removed old automatic variation filling from `loadEditJson`; variation fields now run only inside the ordered edit-page pipeline.
- Expanded category modal plans for the five validation families: bathroom soap dish, desk pen holder, adhesive wall hooks, kitchen sink strainer, adhesive cable clips.
- Added conservative Amazon-title first-token brand cleanup for titles such as `Micoyang Silicone ...`.
- Strengthened real input and checkbox event chains.
- Exposed `window.__DXM_AUTOMATION_V1_LAST_RESULT__` for read-only WebBridge verification.

Validation status:
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node.
- `git diff --check` passed for the source file.
- v1.1.71 source has been prepared for Tampermonkey overwrite.
- Next live step: overwrite Tampermonkey with v1.1.71, refresh sample `167487782006885971`, click `应用编辑页规则` once, read `window.__DXM_AUTOMATION_V1_LAST_RESULT__`, and only save if preflight passes.

Current phase: Validation / full edit-page sequential pipeline prepared

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.70
- Scope: five-product validation preparation; live validation should still start with single sample `167487782006885971`.
- Main change: v1.1.69 minimal two-field mode has been disabled.
- Manual `应用编辑页规则` now runs a single ordered edit-page pipeline under the execution-time scroll blocker.
- Pipeline order: title cleanup -> category -> required attributes -> custom attributes -> marketing image -> ships-from / variation -> freight template 111 -> text sanitization -> preflight.
- The pipeline intentionally skips non-required 店小秘信息, description rewrite, and 其他信息 sections unless later save errors prove they are blockers.
- Soap-dish category selection now starts with `浴室` and targets `便携肥皂盒 / Portable Soap Dishes`; `Bath Baskets` and broad bathroom accessory sets are explicitly rejected.
- Fixed attributes: Brand = `NONE`, High-concerned chemical = `天然未处理(None)`, Origin = `美国(Origin)(US(Origin))`.
- Material uses Amazon/product evidence, e.g. silicone soap dish -> `硅胶 / Silicone`.
- Unknown category-required dropdowns fall back to `其他(Other)` instead of overthinking.
- Ships-from remains fixed to `美国(United States)` and freight template remains fixed to exact `111`.
- Custom attributes are row-deleted or normalized so no value exceeds 70 characters.

Validation status:
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node: `<CODEX_RUNTIME_ROOT>/dependencies/node/bin/node --check src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js`.
- Live Tampermonkey overwrite and single-sample validation are pending.
- Next validation must use only sample `167487782006885971` first, confirm no page jumping, required fields complete, freight template 111 selected, no >70 custom attribute error, and save-to-wait-publish path can trigger without publish.

Current phase: Validation / single-sample edit-page stability repair

Latest prepared source:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.69
- Scope: sample `167487782006885971` only; batch tasks paused.
- Main change: manual edit-rule action is now a minimal exclusive validation mode for the authorized sample only.
- Execution-time interference blocker temporarily suppresses `scrollIntoView`, `scrollTo`, and `scrollBy`.
- Field locks are maintained in memory; locked fields are verified instead of re-executed.
- Only two fields are allowed in this mode: High-concerned chemical -> Origin.
- High-concerned chemical fixed target: `天然未处理(None)`.
- Origin fixed target: `美国(Origin)(US(Origin))`.
- Title/category/material/freight/custom-attribute/variation/batch logic does not run in this minimal mode.
- Syntax check passed; v1.1.69 source has been copied to clipboard for Tampermonkey overwrite.

Validation status:
- Clean live validation is pending after Tampermonkey is overwritten with v1.1.69.
- Temporary WebBridge injection was not accepted as final validation because the older installed userscript still left old listeners/auto behavior in the page.
- No save, wait-publish move, one-click publish, or publish action was executed during this v1.1.69 source-prep step.

Current phase: Validation / v1.1.56 edit-page dropdown and custom-attribute fix prepared

Execution rule update:
- All project issues and optimization items must follow the three-step rule: confirm the issue, optimize it, then verify whether the original work target is achieved.
- Repeatedly changing the same issue without closing it through target verification is not allowed and is treated as a work execution mistake.

Latest v1.1.55 live verification:
- WebBridge opened/refreshed edit sample `167487782006885971`; Chrome reload warning was confirmed only to complete the requested refresh.
- Confirmed panel `DXM Automation V1 V1.1.55`; clicked `应用编辑页规则` exactly once.
- No save, wait-publish move, one-click publish, publish, or `save.json op=1` action was executed.
- Passed: category selected `家居用品 > 家居日用品 > 浴室用品 > 便携肥皂盒（非安装，非金属）(Portable Soap Dishes)`; category did not return to `Bath Baskets`.
- Failed: Brand remained `请选择`; Material remained `请选择`; freight template remained `--- 请选择运费模板 ---`; custom attributes still had one over-70-char value.
- Panel log showed `必填属性未完成` and `运费111未选`; no panel JS error was observed.
- Classification: edit-page dropdown/control completion failure, not product business failure and not environment failure.

Optimization prepared:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW advanced to v1.1.56 source.
- Dropdown search now only targets the currently open dropdown input and includes legacy Ant option classes.
- Required-attribute and freight selection now send select acceptance keys after search input.
- Attribute container scoring penalizes broad parent containers containing multiple required labels.
- Custom attribute cleanup now locates all rows by `属性名/属性值` placeholders and deletes row-local `icon_close` controls.
- Syntax check passed with bundled Node: `<CODEX_RUNTIME_ROOT>/dependencies/node/bin/node --check src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js`.
- Live Tampermonkey overwrite and v1.1.56 target verification are pending.

Live validation attempt:
- Live-confirmed `DXM Automation V1 v1.1.49` and `DXM Amazon Crawlbox V1 v0.1.28`.
- Attempted the five-sample edit-page save validation.
- Sample 1 `167487782006885971` reached edit page; category modal opened and did not close/complete. Category text was visibly written as `Washbasin Trays`, but the modal remained open, so no save was executed.
- Sample 2 `167487782006886749` reached edit page; category modal also opened automatically and remained open.
- Network capture confirmed 0 `/api/smtlocalProduct/save.json` requests and 0 publish / one-click-publish requests.
- Classification: systemic edit-page category-modal control issue, not product business failure.

Optimization prepared:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW advanced to v1.1.50 source.
- Automatic edit-page rules no longer open the category modal on page load.
- Manual preflight category selection now tries modal confirm, close, Escape, and a guarded DOM fallback only after a category is visibly written.
- `node --check src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js` passed.
- v1.1.50 source was copied to clipboard for Tampermonkey overwrite.
- User manually overwrote Tampermonkey and live page confirmed `DXM Automation V1 V1.1.50`.
- Target verification failed: opening sample 1 `167487782006885971` still left the category modal open, and manual `预检并保存` did not complete category selection, custom attribute cleanup, freight template 111 selection, or save.
- Network capture confirmed 0 `/api/smtlocalProduct/save.json` requests and 0 publish / one-click-publish requests during the v1.1.50 verification.
- Original target is still not achieved. Stop further repeated live attempts on the same issue until the category-modal control problem is re-confirmed and optimized as a new single-step fix.
- User clarified that both the top category search field and the column search fields are valid category inputs; category selection should first search broad category, then narrow by column search, then select a valid leaf category.
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW advanced to v1.1.51 source for that mechanism. Syntax check passed. Live overwrite / target verification is pending.
- User manually overwrote v1.1.51 and live page confirmed `DXM Automation V1 V1.1.51` on sample `167487782006885971`. Target verification was only partial: category回填 became visible, but re-running edit-page rules could overwrite the soap-dish category to `Home Office Storage`; custom attributes still had an over-70-char value; freight template `111` was still not visibly selected. This is classified as an edit-page visible-field completion/control failure, not a product business failure.
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW advanced to v1.1.52 source. Fixes prepared: exact category modal plans now take precedence over storage fallback, soap-dish titles are excluded from drawer-storage fast path, required product attributes use fixed low-risk defaults (`Brand=None`, `Feature=Other`, `Function=Other`, unknown required selects prefer `Other`), existing marketing images are recognized without clicking one-key generation, custom attributes normalize before deletion fallback, and freight template selection reports explicit pass/fail so preflight cannot falsely pass. Syntax check passed. Live Tampermonkey overwrite / target verification is pending.

User correction:
- The five-category validation is not complete if it only reaches list/interface dry-run.
- A product must enter the edit page, have visible fields corrected, pass save-before preflight, and then save to wait-to-publish to count as completed.

Root cause of current edit-page screenshots:
- The page is already in product edit.
- Product category, custom attributes, and freight template stayed in their imported/raw state because the edit-page visible-field automation did not run or did not re-run after the draft-list-to-edit-page navigation.
- This is an edit-page control/completion failure, not a product business failure and not a publish failure.

Prepared source fix:
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW advanced to v1.1.49 source.
- Edit-page rules now have a URL-change watcher so category/freight/custom-attribute repair can run after navigating into edit pages.
- Custom attributes remain non-required: default action is clear/skip; if values remain, they are sanitized and limited to <=70 chars instead of repeatedly asking for confirmation.
- Added visible category search terms for current low-risk sample families: adhesive cable clips, adhesive wall hooks, kitchen sink strainers, and bathroom soap dishes.
- User manually overwrote Tampermonkey with v1.1.49 source and refreshed. Read-only confirmation on the Dianxiaomi draft page found `DXM Automation V1 V1.1.49` and `data-dxm-automation-version=1.1.49`.

Batch-flow optimization prepared:
- DXM Amazon Crawlbox V1 advanced to v0.1.28 source.
- User manually overwrote Tampermonkey with v0.1.28 source. Read-only confirmation on the Dianxiaomi draft page found `DXM Amazon Crawlbox V1 v0.1.28` panel visible.
- Controlled current-batch batch claim is the default when ASIN batch is known, native auto-claim is off, and current unclaimed rows match the batch.
- Row-by-row claim is exception fallback only and must record the failure reason.
- Single-store claim modal auto-selects the only available store; multi-store without configured target blocks as `store_uncertain`.
- Logo review sheet exports `allow_collect` / `needs_review` / `skip_logo_or_brand_risk`.
- Run metrics export includes target quantity, actual quantity, total time, per-item average, timeout threshold, slow-point classification, and stage-duration fields. Missing downstream timers are marked `耗时未量化`.

Validation:
- `node --check src/dianxiaomi-automation-v1-merged-new.user.js` passed.
- `node --check src/dianxiaomi-amazon-crawlbox-v1.user.js` passed.
- No Dianxiaomi save, wait-publish move, one-click publish, publish, or save.json op=1 action was executed during this source fix.

Next:
- User overwrites Tampermonkey with DXM Automation V1 v1.1.56 source, then refreshes sample `167487782006885971`.
- Confirm live page shows `DXM Automation V1 V1.1.56`.
- Click `应用编辑页规则` once and verify: Brand `NONE`, Material `Silicone/Silicone Rubber/硅胶`, freight template `111`, custom attributes empty/no >70 chars, category remains `Portable Soap Dishes`, panel log has no JS error.
- If v1.1.56 passes this single-sample target, return to five-category small-sample validation.
```

Excluded:
- B0BCHYTNHZ was accidentally claimed to product-development collection box; exclude from overseas-managed edit validation.

Dry-run / save-preflight:
- 5 / 5 effective samples were blocked before save.
- 0 saved to wait-to-publish.
- 0 save.json op=1 calls.
- 0 publish calls.
- Common blocker: platform-disallowed quote / size-symbol characters remained in PC/mobile descriptions, attributes, and SKU/spec fields.
- Category blocker: B09PFW8WRQ had categoryResolver unresolved and invalid categoryId `5050263-`.
- PC image/detailWeb guard stayed active; no interface-save bypass occurred because dry-run never passed.

Report:
- runs/v1148-five-category-single-product-preflight-report.md

Decision:
- Do not enter small-batch validation yet.
- Next step is source fix for text sanitation coverage, wall-hook category resolution, and claim modal store-selection guard.

Decision:
- v1.1.48 PC description preflight guard is effective for blocking invalid detailWeb.
- Next validation should use one real current draft/claimed product with valid current-product images to confirm pass-path image-first detailWeb.
- Do not publish.
- Do not click save.json op=1 until pass-path dry-run is confirmed and explicitly authorized.

Current phase: Validation code-prep / fixing 10-item same-category blockers before rerun

Source prepared after user feedback:
- DXM Amazon Crawlbox V1 v0.1.27 prepared.
- DXM Automation V1 - NEW v1.1.45 prepared.

Purpose:
- Fix mechanical collection/claim actions before rerunning 10 same-category validation.
- Fix category/attribute judgment so broad organizer trays are not forced into a narrow underwear/clothing storage path.

Prepared fixes:
- Collection input detection now prefers the fixed link/URL textarea instead of guessing by largest input box.
- Before clicking 开始采集, the script checks that the collection box contains the same Amazon-link count as the current batch.
- Collection stale timeout is now 30 seconds; stale progress triggers refresh/check.
- Visible dangerous buttons only produce warning; only an imminent dangerous click is blocked.
- Controlled current-batch batch claim is allowed through a separate safe action name, while naked 批量认领 remains blocked.
- Category resolver now checks the full Dianxiaomi path. Clothing/underwear paths are penalized unless product evidence clearly supports clothing/underwear use.
- Material is now inferred from Amazon title/detail evidence with acrylic/plastic/silicone/rubber/metal/wood/fiberglass candidates.
- Visible edit-page required attributes now use hard project defaults where appropriate:
  Brand = None / no brand; High-concerned chemical = 天然未处理(None);
  Origin = United States; Function / Use prefer Other or reusable-style safe values.
- Frame Material and Material are filled separately from the same Amazon material inference.
- Visible preflight now rejects already-selected but wrong attribute values such as Origin=Mainland China or Use=Food.
- Variation parameter Ships From is fixed to United States through the visible checkbox section.
- Freight template must be truly selected as template `111`; writing text into the field is still not enough.

No Dianxiaomi business page action was executed for this source-prep step.
Do not rerun 10-item validation until the prepared scripts are installed/active and confirmed read-only.
Do not click 发布 or 一键发布.

Current phase: Validation / 10-item same-category category-attribute verification

Judgment correction:
- B0BY2M154R is only a chain sample.
- A single product cannot prove Dianxiaomi category or attribute correctness.

Drawer Organizers 10-item run:
- selected: 10 new same-category drawer organizer tray ASINs
- collected: 10 success / 0 fail
- claimed: 10 success / 0 fail / 0 duplicate skip
- claim method: single-row claim only; no batch claim
- store: Halo Home Store
- DeepSeek Product Understanding: 10 / 10 passed local Rule Engine
- final publish: not executed
- 30-item / 3x10: not entered

Current edit-save blocker:
- First opened edit product: 167487782006844693 / B0CDNP8FCL.
- Dianxiaomi category search found and visibly selected Drawer Organizers:
  家居用品(Home & Garden) > 家用储存收藏用具(Home Storage & Organization) > 衣物收纳(Clothing & Wardrobe Storage) > 内衣收纳盒(Drawer Organizers)
- Save was not executed because edit preflight still failed:
  Brand = 请选择
  Material = 请选择
  page shows 请选择必选变种属性
  freight template = --- 请选择运费模板 ---

Do not enter 3x10 until the Drawer Organizers edit-page filler is fixed and the same 10-product set can save to wait-to-publish.
Do not click 发布 or 一键发布.

## Latest Read-only Smoke Finding

```text
Amazon collection entry page checked read-only at:
https://www.dianxiaomi.com/web/productCrawl/dataAcquisition

Observed:
- DXM Amazon Crawlbox V1 v0.1.22 panel visible.
- Crawlbox stayed idle: batch not created, imported 0, claimed 0.
- DXM Automation V1 V1.1.43 panel visible, with no observed execution into read/dry-run/save/publish.
- save Payload V3 0.6.3 panel visible; hook injected.
- save Payload record count changed to 3 after entering the page. Latest visible record showed empty op/id; no save/publish payload was observed.
- Console showed no project userscript errors. qiyukf.com / hm.baidu.com / Mixed Content third-party page noise remains ignored.

Decision:
- User confirmed current read-only smoke testing has passed.
- save Payload V3 record count 3 was judged non-blocking because the records were page initialization / config / list requests, not save/publish payloads.

Controlled Smoke Test pre-check:
- Store/native Dianxiaomi "自动认领" was observed checked on the collection page.
- Per the controlled smoke boundary, no collection action was triggered while auto-claim is enabled.
- No claim, edit, save, or publish action was executed.

Controlled 1-link Smoke Test:
- User authorized unchecking the Dianxiaomi native "自动认领" checkbox and running one controlled collection.
- "自动认领" was unchecked and verified as Value 0 before collection.
- One Amazon candidate was selected: `https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5WNXRY9`.
- Light pre-check result: allowed to collect.
- Only the explicit "开始采集" button was clicked.
- Dianxiaomi collection result modal reported: successfully collected 1, failed 0.
- Collection box count changed from total 6452 / unclaimed 0 / claimed 6452 to total 6453 / unclaimed 1 / claimed 6452.
- No claim, edit, save, publish, "采集并一键发布", or 3x10 action was executed.
- Post-run review found three issues before scaling: collection speed is slow, Computer Use is inefficient during collection, and the selected product main image/package contains a visible brand/logo mark.
- ASIN `B0F5WNXRY9` disposition: collection succeeded, but product-selection filtering missed a logo risk. Reason: main image / packaging image contains visible logo or brand text. Stop any downstream claim, edit, save, or publish action for this product.
```

## Pre-3x10 Improvement Items

```text
1. Collection speed: observed slow in the controlled 1-link Smoke Test; needs a faster controlled execution method before 3x10.
2. Computer Use efficiency: repeated UI-state reads/click observations are too slow for collection runs; future runs should minimize Computer Use to required boundary confirmations and use script/page instrumentation where safe.
3. Product selection quality: the collected candidate image/package showed a visible brand/logo mark; future candidate pre-check must inspect main image, packaging, collage sub-images, and visible text before allowing collection.
4. Crawlbox source prepared as v0.1.23: default `requireLogoApproval` changed from `0` to `1`, so candidates require explicit no-logo approval before becoming collectable.
5. Second 1-link Smoke Test completed after explicitly refreshing both Dianxiaomi and Amazon pages: page-level `DXM Amazon Crawlbox V1 v0.1.23` and `Logo确认=1` were confirmed active before collection.
6. Second Smoke candidate `B0B1M6ML2J` was selected after light visual review: no obvious main-image logo, brand watermark, or brand packaging was observed; product is a clear plastic drawer organizer, price observed at 17.99 USD on Amazon and 19.99 USD in Dianxiaomi after collection.
7. Second Smoke collection result: Dianxiaomi reported collected 1 / failed 0. Collection box changed from total 6453 / unclaimed 1 / claimed 6452 to total 6454 / unclaimed 2 / claimed 6452, confirming no automatic claim.

## WebBridge Preflight Export Fix - Source Prepared 2026-06-28

```text
Prepared DXM Amazon Crawlbox V1 v0.1.25.

Purpose:
- make full preflight result readable by Kimi WebBridge
- avoid relying only on userscript sandbox window

Readable outputs:
- window.__DXM_WEBBRIDGE_PREFLIGHT__ inside userscript context
- unsafeWindow.__DXM_WEBBRIDGE_PREFLIGHT__ when allowed
- page-context window.__DXM_WEBBRIDGE_PREFLIGHT__ through injected script
- #dxm-webbridge-preflight-json DOM JSON fallback
- data-dxm-webbridge-* page attributes

No business action was executed for this update.
```

## Product Understanding Rule Gate - Source Prepared 2026-06-28

```text
DeepSeek API access has been verified with deepseek-v4-flash.

Added Product Understanding output constraints:
- fixed schema: product-understanding-v1
- forbidden publish advice: publish / review and publish / 发布 / 上架 / 刊登 / 一键发布
- local Rule Engine validation required before edit-page category or attributes can use the output

New files:
- skills/product-understanding/schema.json
- skills/product-understanding/rules.json
- tools/validate-product-understanding.py
- docs/product-understanding-output-rules.md

Offline validation:
- old DeepSeek-style output containing "Review and publish" was blocked
- schema-compliant B00AN8CTX0 fixture passed

Boundary:
- Product Understanding may only suggest category search terms and attribute candidates
- Dianxiaomi visible category, project rules, logo/brand checks, freight template 111, and save preflight remain authoritative
- no Dianxiaomi business action was executed
```

## DeepSeek Product Understanding Adapter - Source Prepared 2026-06-28

```text
Added:
- tools/deepseek-product-understanding-adapter.py

Adapter behavior:
- reads DeepSeek config from local Codex config
- calls deepseek-v4-flash or consumes saved raw output
- extracts DeepSeek JSON content
- converts output into product-understanding-v1
- sanitizes publish / review and publish / 发布 advice before final validation
- invokes tools/validate-product-understanding.py
- only validated output can be used as category, attribute, title, or description suggestion input

B00AN8CTX0 offline validation:
- product type: DrawerOrganizer / Drawer Organizer Tray
- use: organizing drawers for makeup or office supplies
- recommended category: Drawer Organizers
- attributes: material Plastic, color Clear, 6 sections, brand NONE
- Rule Engine: passed

Boundary:
- no Dianxiaomi page was opened or operated
- no collection, claim, edit, save, or publish action was executed
```

## 1-3 Small-Sample Edit-Save Validation Attempt - Blocked 2026-06-28

```text
Authorized target:
- choose 1-3 low-risk products
- collect -> claim -> edit -> DeepSeek Product Understanding -> Rule Engine -> save to wait-to-publish
- no final publish

Actual result:
- stopped before product selection or collection
- no Dianxiaomi business action was executed

Preflight:
- DXM Amazon Crawlbox V1 v0.1.25 active
- window / DOM WebBridge preflight readable
- native auto-claim: closed
- collection input: present
- collection counts: total 6453 / unclaimed 0 / claimed 6453
- dangerous buttons visible: 采集并一键发布, 批量认领, 一键发布
- preflight result: blocked

Decision:
- do not bypass safety layer
- do not collect, claim, edit, save, or publish until the dangerous-button rule is refined or explicitly waived
```

## WebBridge Safety Layer v0.1.26 - Source Prepared 2026-06-28

```text
Prepared DXM Amazon Crawlbox V1 v0.1.26.

Rule change:
- dangerous button visible: warning only
- dangerous target action: block
- target button "开始采集": allowed if other blocking rules pass

Preflight output now includes:
- warnings
- blocked
- allowed
- targetButtonText
- blockReason

Validation:
- source syntax check passed
- v0.1.26 source copied to clipboard for Tampermonkey overwrite

Boundary:
- browser page still needs Tampermonkey overwrite and page-level v0.1.26 confirmation
- no Dianxiaomi business action was executed after this source update
```

## v0.1.26 1-Item Small-Sample Edit-Save Validation - Stopped At Edit Wizard 2026-06-28

```text
Live validation:
- DXM Amazon Crawlbox V1 v0.1.26 active on Dianxiaomi page
- visible dangerous buttons: warning only
- target "开始采集": allowed
- native auto-claim: closed
- collection input/counts: readable

Sample:
- Store: Halo Home Store
- ASIN: B0BY2M154R
- Product: clear drawer organizer / storage tray set
- Visual precheck: main image did not show obvious logo or brand packaging
- Brand risk: Amazon title/byline contains Ravinte; must be cleaned before save or move-to-wait-publish

Executed:
- collected through explicit "开始采集": success 1 / failed 0
- single row claim only, not batch claim
- claim to Halo Home Store: success 1 / failed 0 / duplicate 0
- DeepSeek Product Understanding passed local Rule Engine
- product appears in https://www.dianxiaomi.com/web/smtlocalProduct/draft

Stopped:
- row "编辑" opens the edit wizard
- "编辑分类" closes the wizard and returns to the draft list
- "跳过，去编辑产品" also closes the wizard and returns to the draft list
- editable page did not become available through WebBridge

Not executed:
- no field edit
- no save
- no move to wait-to-publish
- no publish
- no batch claim
- no 10-item or 30-item validation

Report:
- runs/webbridge-v0126-small-sample-edit-save-report.md
- runs/product-understanding-B0BY2M154R.report.json

Current blocker:
- smtlocalProduct/draft edit wizard needs a dedicated WebBridge/DOM handler or Computer Use fallback before another edit-save attempt.
```
